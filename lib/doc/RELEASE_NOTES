- Removed commands: mc, isql, language
- The help command now handles aliased commands.
- Corrected some quirks in editing and the detection of in_input()
  that caused some entered characters to be invisible in charmode.
- Standardized help output for commands. Note that the standard is now
  for the help message to be a string returned from GetHelp(), not
  a write() or a message() or whatever crazy thing occurs to people
  in the middle of the night in 1994.
- The "boards" command now indicates the location of the boards listed.
- Admins can now use the gag command to prevent a user from using channels.
- Fixed a password retrieval problem in ftp and hftp. 
  NOTE: Some newer ftp clients default to epsv when negotiating passive
  ftp mode. This breaks hftp. If you're having weird problems using
  passive mode and hftp, then right after logging into hftp, type:
  epsv off
  passive on
  bin
- Fixed a double-prompt problem and some cosmetic issues when reprompting.

  gaps in mapping.
- Slightly streamlined the character generation process, removing
  questions that are rarely answered and not requiring "pick" to
  precede the race and class.
- Added the ob, name, and obname elements to the MagicProtection class in
  magic_protection.h in order to better track and control multiple
  magic protections. See /powers/spells/buffer.c for an example of
  a spell that checks these in order to avoid stacking.
- Fixed IMC2 colors.
- Exempted file commands from Diku "2.thing" parsing rules.

  advancement process.
- Added sefun: comma()

---- 2.11a19 ---

- Added a more efficient auto-mapping drone.
- Rooms can now specify their own coords, for example:
  SetCoordinates("-3000,3000,0");

  their info.
- Parse matching now also checks for emotes.

---- 2.11a17 ---
- Released 2009-09-11

  cut down on verb guessing.
- The lines command has been verbified to simplify its synonymization
  and documentation.
- Fixed channel emote problem reported by Flumpy.
- Command matching no longer arbitrarily picks the first matching
  command if there is more than one.
- Added command: bugs, queue
- Fixed a problem in PLAYERS_D that prevented suicides from working.
- Fixed a problem in INSTANCES_D that double-pumped channel messages.
- Driver: The parser now defaults to the first matching object in
  commands with ambiguous hits. You can "get key" rather than "get
  first key" and this is parsed in the driver rather than the lib.

---- 2.11a9 ---
- Released 2009-07-19
- Driver is now a slightly modified pre-release Fluffos 2.17.
- Fixed remote channel problem in CHAT_D.
- /secure/include/mssp.h is now somewhat more individualized.
- Added commands: screenlock, weigh
- Driver: Added partial support for telopts NEW-ENVIRON (rfc 1572).
  A connection that supports this will cause the driver to call
  the receive_environ() apply in LIB_CONNECT, sending the env data
  as a single string.
- Added support for using anyterm (http://anyterm.org) as
  a client while still identifying player IP's.
- Fixed a problem listing individual items from vendors.
- Replaced broken xterm definition map in TERMINAL_D with ansi def.

  data packet before transmission.
- i3router: channel-add packets with invalid channel types are
  now rejected.
- The mudconfig command now handles mud name and port changes.
- IMC2 channels now have their remote names mapped to their local
  names automatically, avoiding the need to hardcode the maps in CHAT_D.
- Added commands: chan, rotatelogs
- Updated the ced editor with some important fixes. It can now be
  enabled with mudconfig (mudconfig ced on). Note that this is a highly
  experimental editor, so it automatically backs up any file you edit
  with it. See the help info for: ced, bk, restore, charmode
- The windows install no longer needs the absolute path to be
  c:\ds if the new default runmud.bat and mudos.win32 are used.
- Instances on Windows are now supported.
- Telopts MSSP support added, plaintext MSSP improved.
  See: http://dead-souls.net/ds-admin-faq.html#145
- i3router: the "listening" portion of irn channel updates is
  no longer sent.
- i3router: blacklisting of networks is now possible.
- i3router: muds that attempt to reconnect more than once per second
  are subject to automatic temporary graylisting.
- Fixed an exploit reported by Ideysus that allowed local creators to
  spoof intermud packets.
- Removed command: mfinger
- Updated the performance score calculation to make it more consistent.

- Alleviated some misfortunes in instance tells.
- The mudconfig command now works properly with imc2 password setting
  and the secrets daemon.
- General cleanup of superfluous debugging statements.
- Substring searching added to ced.

---- 2.9a18 ---
- Released 2009-05-05
- Fixed a problem with the new reply aging system.
- Fixed a bug in liveupgrading that overwrote SECRETS_H.

---- 2.9a17 ---
- Released 2009-05-01
- Driver is now a slightly modified FluffOS 2.16.
- Converted structs to mappings in CLASSES_D.
- Fixed CLASSES_D bug that inverted the position of "importance" and
  "average starting level" of classes.
- Instances now share local channels.
- Users on different instances can now tell to each other.
- Users on different instances can now get "finger" info on each other.
- Users on different instances can now see each other in "who".
- Added commands: instconfig, deviate, destfile
- New players can't create a character if the same name is used
  on another instance. 
- Added sefuns: remote_users(), local_users()
- The actions map elements in LIB_ROOM now actually fire based on
  their individual "chance" rather than the overall ActionChance
  (thx Raudhrskal!).
- IMC2 tells now work like i3 tells, no need to use the "imc2" command.
- AUTO_WIZ set above 1 now forces new users to become creators, rather
  than providing the choice to do so.
- IP addresses of users are no longer displayed to creators on
  AUTO_WIZ muds.
- Users on different instances can now shout to each other.
- Fixed problems in the router code when a mud's fd is 0.
- IMC2 client host/port info now does a better job of being correct.
- IRN nodes now periodically send each other mud and chan lists.
- Some password thingies like i3 and IMC2 are now handled by a
  secrets daemon, to improve security.
- The non-quitting non-net-dead destruction of users is now announced
  and logged (for example, if you "dest" a creator).
- Suicide notes now save somewhere more reasonable.
- Paths in read.cfg and write.cfg can now have wildcard files.
- Added STATS_D and SKILLS_D. They are meant to keep track of which
  stats and skills have been used in the mud, and when possible, 
  maintain information the "importance" of a stat to a race and a
  skill to a class, derived by RACES_D and CLASSES_D respectively. 
  This allows a centralized repository of stat/skill information
  that the DEVIATION_D can rely on for deviation calculation.
- Added a stat deviation system. A player can now have an improved
  stat class, but at a cost of some percentage of earned XP. See:
  help deviation
- The hist command now reverts to the old "query the chat cache"
  behavior if the mud doesn't log the type of channel being queried.
  Note that by default, remote channels are not logged.
- Fixed an odd display problem in the hist command.
- SNOOP_D can now ignore ip's (good for running bot tests from a known
  ip), and admins can now be monitored if set to be so explicitly,
  overriding GLOBAL_MONITOR == 2.
- Fixed userlist generation in PLAYERS_D in an instance.
- Since IMC2 servers do not handle usernames with spaces well, IMC2_D
  now strips spaces from names before sending channel messages.
- Stargates can now register with the stargate daemon only if they are
  in /domains/ or /secure/, to avoid dozens of accidental newbie 
  stargates to creator realms.
- The prompt command without an argument now returns the raw prompt
  string, rather than setting a null prompt.
- Added improvements to the colors command by Raudhrskal.
- Cleaned up the lines command.
- Reply target is now reset on login, and ages out after 15 minutes
  of not replying and not receiving a message from that target.
- Inventory output now has worn things at the bottom, and wielded
  things just above worn things.
- SetEncounter() on aggro npc's now keys on GetInvis() rather than
  query_invis() for somewhat more predictable results when trying
  to sneak around.
- Players on instances no longer get booted off during warmboots.

---- 2.9a16 ---
- Released 2009-03-12
- The "locate" command is now "i3locate".
- Prettified the tabbed file completion stuff.
- Armor now makes more of an effort to resolve ambiguous
  targets, such as "wear ring" when both hands can take a ring.
- Added BaseLimbs to armor in order to resolve ambiguous situations
  involving sets of limbs, such as a shield which needs a paired
  arm and hand, plus torso. 
- LIB_WORN_STORAGE now uses inherited LIB_BASE_ARMOR and 
  LIB_BASE_STORAGE as inherited code to avoid discrepancies in 
  behavior in duplicated code. Note this means that the majority
  of the code for armor is now in LIB_BASE_ARMOR and the majority of the
  code for "things that hold other things" is now in LIB_BASE_STORAGE.
- Added GetMaxSkillLevel() to LIB_ABILITIES to consolidate the
  calculation that was previously duplicated by multiple commands.
- Fixed a bug that allowed skill levels in negative numbers.
- Cleaned up some behavior with ANOXIA damage and respiration types.
- Commands that queued when in combat (such as 'inventory') used
  to hang indefinitely if you chased your quarry into a "no attack" 
  room. This is no longer the case.
- Persistent rooms no longer spawn excess copies of unique 
  or MaxClone objects.
- The fighter's hall in Ylsrim is now a proper, working class hall
  with class joining and training available.
- Fixed a bug in the flood object that generated performance
  problems over time.
- Fixed a bug in the flood object that failed to set the respiration
  type correctly when a room became completely flooded.
- Fixed a problem with warmboots that caused some doors to
  have issues being locked/unlocked/manipulated.
- Objects that drop into "void" due to a problem with their 
  environment now are sent to individualized "virtual voids" if
  the ROOMS_D can resolve that. This avoids some rare circumstances
  where a huge number of npc's and players fall into a single 
  "void" room and mayhem ensues. 
- Fixed a conflict in QCS with customdefs.h that made it difficult
  to modify your workroom.
- The goto command now handles global coordinates, eg: goto 2,2
- The command "imc2 list" now only returns muds currently connected,
  to avoid a timeout receiving data from a long list of defunct muds.
- Fixed a problem in scoped heartbeats that prevented players
  from autosaving.
- COMPAT BUSTER: debug() now just takes two args, making it 
  more like tc(). Example:
  debug on
  eval debug("My skills: "+identify(this_player()->GetSkills()),"red")
- It is now possible to carry living things. Creators can get creatures
  of any size, but players can only pick up creatures smaller than them
  by at least 2 size slots. Note that picking up an NPC you have not
  befriended will make it attack you.
- Fixed a bug in updating virtual rooms.
- You can now run multiple instances of the same code without clobbering
  savefiles. If you set ENABLE_INSTANCES in config.h, then reboot, 
  objects will add the mud's port to their save name, for example
  "rooms.6666.o" rather than "rooms.o". Obviously this means that the
  different instances need to be on different ports. For an example
  of how to do it: help instances
- Clepius can now extract bullets, if you give him an excision slip.
- Fixed a carried weight conflict in vehicles and mounts.
- tell_room() now works on string names of virtual rooms.
- Fixed a parsing peculiarity when trying to read one book when
  others are available.
- Added a hint book to Kim's bookstore.
- If you were in a virtual room during a warmboot, you are returned
  to it after the warmboot completes.
- Creators can now keep track of things sneaking in and out of their
  inventory with call me->SetParanoia("inventory_monitoring", 1). They
  can also keep track of where they might be silently moved to with
  call me->SetParanoia("move_monitoring", 1). Note that these are not
  foolproof, and the proper way to deal with mischief is not paranoia
  but extreme violence and harsh language.
- The "which" command now identifies aliases, add_actions, etc.
- Finally nailed a mysterious data overwrite problem in PLAYERS_D.

---- 2.9a15 ---
- Liveupgrade only.
- Intermediate release to handle special liveupgrade issues.

---- 2.9a14 ---
- Released 2009-02-04
- Driver is now a slightly modified FluffOS 2.15.
- Added an experimental screen-mode inheritable editor, see 
  LIB_CEDIT and: help ced . It's still a bit quirky and buggy, and
  incomplete (handles wrapping poorly, doesn't do search/replace,
  etc). For now it's a proof-of-concept/prototype with saving disabled
  (thx to Tricky and Raudhrskal for advice on terminal control). Will
  not work without charmode. Will not work without FluffOS 2.15-ds*.
- Added sefuns: system_month(), system_day(), write2()
- Added sefuns from Chaos@Lost Souls: levenshtein_distance(),
  damerau_levenshtein_distance()
- Added commands: commandecho, profile, timezone, efuns, sefuns, lfuns
- Driver: added ANSI_SUBSTITUTE define to comm.c in order to
  control which character is substituted with in NO_ANSI.
- It's now possible to re-engage in combat with an opponent you've
  previously ignored.
- Rooms now attempt to set their own respiration type based on
  their medium, if their respiration type is not already set.
- The longcat command now tries a bit harder to display ludicrously
  large files.
- The commands dsversion and noclip work again.
- Various conflicts in coordinate setting fixed.
- Mitigated a compat buster in QCS involving customdefs.
- Miscellaneous performance tweaks to make DS friendlier to use
  on weak hardware. Tested on a Pentium 133MHz and 
  an UltraSparcII 300MHz.
- Changed the name "automap" to "minimap". Automapping will mean
  something else in later releases.
- Implemented a "minimum performance" threshold for certain
  resource-intensive features. The performance score of a system is 
  determined by CPU time taken at boot. The MIN_PERF define in config.h
  establishes the minimum score required for "heavy" features like
  wizmapping and file/function indexing. This system allows people with
  weak machines to use DS without tons of errors, and it allows people
  with fast machines to enjoy the fancy stuff by default.
- Fixed a problem in FUNCTION_D that prevented the lib from having
  function data when running on Windows.
- Warmboot no longer hoses up people in charmode.
- MASTER_D now forces a quick shutdown if it detects one of the following:
    * Exhausted file descriptors.
    * Eval cost error cascade loop.
- Driver: added efun remove_charmode()
- The hist command now includes timestamps and accepts a number
  argument for how many lines to display.
- Fixed local_time() to accept a string timezone.
- Commands like "date" and "people" now have output customized to the 
  player's timezone.
- Driver: fixed command() efun so that success is nonzero 
  when running on Windows.
- Charmode now works on Windows (see command() above).
- The hist command now also handles: say, whisper, yell, shout.
- Fixed a bug in LIB_BODY that caused decapitation during combat
  to occur twice, resulting in two severed heads.
- The "nightmare shell" now does tabbed command completion,
  tabbed filename completion, tabbed object completion, and 
  up/down-arrow command recall when in charmode.
- The findfun command now also identifies efuns and sefuns, and
  tries to suggest other possible matches based on differing
  case and format. It also now takes a substring flag to search
  efuns, sefuns, and lfuns for possible matches.
- Guarding works properly again. You can no longer take Kim's
  cash register.

---- 2.9a13 ---
- Released 2009-01-04
- Finally got around to indenting everything consistently.
- Improved handling of missing/broken rooms in ROOMS_D.
- The noclip command now enables "noclip mode" rather than
  being a command for moving in a specific direction. While in
  noclip mode you can move through closed doors and walls if
  the rooms daemon is aware of an adjacent room in that direction,
  even with no explicit exit there.
- Fixed some vaguenesses in death notices.
- Virtual rooms now immediately unload when the last object in their
  inventory leaves. This allows, for example, launching a torpedo that 
  travels 200 rooms without now having to have 200 totally useless 
  rooms hanging around in memory.
- Added commands: reprompt, charmode, keepalive
- The reprompt mode redraws your prompt when you receive
  messages, similar to how Diku muds do so. Note
  that reprompt mode looks awful on most mud clients...it's
  intended for folks with "single pane" clients, like people
  using a default Linux telnet client.
- The charmode command puts you into character mode, so that
  your input is received on a per-keystroke basis, rather than
  a per-line basis. This allows for stuff like using up and down
  arrows for command recall. This is for single-pane clients
  only! Most mud clients will fail to handle this...and they
  may fail very horribly. This mode is experimental and 
  somewhat broken at the moment. Unsupported on Windows muds.
- Fixed bug in LIB_BODY that caused overlapping armor to increase
  damage received.
- The default player prompt now includes status info.
- Driver: Fixed a bug in comm.c that failed to reset to linemode 
  if the object with the get_char() target function was destructed.
- Some damage limits have been raised. You may find your npc's
  and weapons doing substantially more damage. See MAX_POWER and
  MAX_SKILL in LIB_COMBAT.
- i3router: Connection freakouts by blacklisted muds are now handled 
  more gracefully.
- Added sefuns: present_file(), present_bonus(), query_unique_name()
- Driver: added efuns: query_charmode(), remove_get_char(), 
  send_nullbyte() (thanks, Raudhrskal!)
- AUTO_WIZ no longer prevents class selection.
- Unified command history code into LIB_HISTORY and rewrote a bit in
  order to use mappings rather than arrays, to avoid ambiguities.
- The customdefs.h file for creators and builders is now in their
  area/ directory. This is to make it easier to migrate such an
  area to domains/ once it is complete.
- Consolidated the calculation of max health points into LIB_RACE,
  fixing some issues with strangely overhealthy npc's during combat
  (eg kitchen rats).
- Added Raudhrskal's implementation of Daelaskai's evaldefs idea
  (thx guys).
- If a thing doesn't have SetDamagePoints() called on it, it will
  not deteriorate when it receives damage.
- Items in perfect condition no longer indicate their condition.
- Implemented basic persistence for rooms. If a room is SetNoClean(1),
  has SetPersist(1); in create() and RestoreObject(); on the
  following line, then when it reloads, it will restore into
  its inventory whatever was left there...even across reboots. 
  For an example, see /domains/town/room/secret.c
- Containers can also have persistence set, but *BEWARE*. Any
  item you set to be persistent in this way should be unique
  in the mud. Having multiple clones of an object with persistent
  inventory may result in hilarity, but very likely also 
  confusion and sadness in an open mud. For an example of an item with
  persistent inventory, see /domains/town/obj/charity.c
  *IMPORTANT NOTE*: carryable items that are made persistent will
  appear to behave oddly when you "reload" and "update" them, and
  modify them with QCS. This is because QCS does not actually
  destroy them right away, and in fact for a brief time you have
  two of the same item in the mud, stepping on each other's persistent
  inventory. Expect to see weirdness when using QCS with persistent items.
- Land-based rooms can now have respiration types other than R_AIR.
  For an example, see: /domains/default/room/vacuum.c
  You can also test by issuing the commands:
  goto /domains/default/room/menagerie
  eval return HERE->SetRespirationType(R_VACUUM)
  and seeing most everything drop dead within seconds.

---- 2.9a12 ---
- Released 2008-11-26
- DECAY_D is now more resistant to runtime-error failures.
- Minor improvements to stress testing.
- At the advice of Silenus, switched the world grid from string based
  multidimensional mappings to bitshifted integer based multidimensional
  mappings, which not only cut down mapping depth by 35%, but also
  increased lookup speed by more than an order of magnitude. Many
  thanks to Silenus for holding my hand through figuring out how to
  bash the bits.
- Portals no longer fall or sink.
- Warmboots deal more firmly now with situations where very many
  rooms are loaded.
- The imc2 channel "ichat" is no longer enabled by default due to
  a change in their content policy making them no longer PG-13. To enable 
  it for yourself, you would type: call me->AddChannel("ichat")
- New creators now automatically "wizmap" rather than "automap".
- Added Town Well quest.
- Added LIB_FLOW as an example of a "flooding" type object.

---- 2.9a11 ---
- Released 2008-11-20
- Driver is now a slightly modified FluffOS 2.14.
- Fixed a parser crasher in the driver that occurs under 
  unusually heavy loads.
- Parsing ambiguity in grenades fixed up a bit.
- Bots now handle too-bright and too-dark rooms more sensibly.
- Bots now handle paged displays more sensibly.
- Room inventories will now accept a function for the number
  of items. For an example of a random number of rats between
  1 and 5, see /domains/town/room/mansion_room7.c
- You can now limit the number of of clones of an npc or an item
  that the mud will load as inventory. If a sword's base file
  has SetMaxClones(15), then a room will not try to load the
  sword in its inventory if the mud already has 15 of these swords
  cloned somewhere. Note that SetMaxClones() in a base file
  will cause the object not to be saved in a player's inventory
  when they quit. For an example, see /domains/default/armor/wristcomp.c
- Fixed a problem in CreWeb editing with wrapping and line numbering
  that displayed incorrect line numbers.
- Fixed a driver crasher involving the destruction of objects
  while they are in a verb parsing loop.
- Fixed a problem with passing functionals to SetAction() in rooms
  (thx, Raudhrskal!).
- Added a prototype overland map system. It's mostly in the testing
  phase, as it tends to lag the mud somewhat. Creators can enable
  automatic mapping with: wizmap on
- Minor fixes of rooms with grid conflicts.
- Added command: wizmap
- Fixed a problem with the npc guard system that prevented more
  than one guard from being able to guard in the same room.
- Fixed what is essentially borken behavior in Set/GetItems
  that have a functional. However, I suspect that this behavior has
  actually been assimilated all over the place as being a standard,
  so the effect here is a possible *slight* compat buster, with
  SetItems that have functionals displaying output twice.
- Added a portal generator, and cake to go along with it.
- Added new domain: /domains/cave as an undergound orc stronghold.
  It's mostly done, though I'll be adding more to it eventually.
  Note that this is an example of "an area where normal creators and
  overpowered players are not welcome". This is a feature I'm
  testing to see how feasible it is to prevent casual-abuse type
  creators from being too much of a nuisance on an open mud.

---- 2.9a10 ---
- Released 2008-10-19
- Fixed peculiar problem in the get verb that sometimes made
  it seem as though an open container was closed, for creators.
- It is now exceedingly difficult to fight or
  defend when not standing, or when your vision is poor.
- Added command: gridconfig
- Minor grid conflicts cleaned up.
- Fixed a permissions issue that prevents doors from showing up
  for players without read access to an area.
- Value for meals now defaults to base cost.
- Reaping tidied up: REAPER_D now fires up at boot time, and
  reap_other() will scour for environmentless clones whether
  the driver is FluffOS or not.
- Players are now addressable by their race.
- Added a "max attacks per heartbeat" throttle to combat.c to
  avoid having creators in godmode with ludicrous stats causing
  the mud to seize up fighting each other.
- Fixed a too long eval in warmbooting.
- LIB_COMMAND now handles multi-word bare exits ("foo bar" rather than
  "go foo bar").
- Added Kalinash's driver mod to override new() with clone_object() if the
  clone_object() sefun exists.
- valid_edit() in LIB_BOARD now works more sensibly and denies edit
  and deletion access to people who should not have it.
- "give all to X" now works like selling and putting: worn and wielded
  items are not automatically surrendered.
- Fixed some parsing issues with booby traps.
- clone_object() is now overridden with a throttle to prevent
  accidental cloning cascades from creator objects.
- Added MEMUSE_SOFT_LIMIT and MEMUSE_HARD_LIMIT. These are disabled
  by default. They are intended to provide some control over memory
  usage, for folks on commercial hosting or resource-starved computers.
  For details, see: help config
- Added driver fix for check_memory() crasher.
- Added max player limits in LIB_CONNECT based on compile-time-
  detected file descriptor max.
- Fixed a crasher in the driver that occurs under very rare
  high-network-load stress.

---- 2.9a9 ---
- Released 2008-09-24
- Driver is now a slightly modified pre-release FluffOS 2.14v27.
- Revolvers no longer change caliber spontaneously.
- Basic IMC2 server added.
- IRN "not my mud" endless loop when more than 2 nodes is fixed.
- Added "chanlist-req" to the router. You can now get a chanlist
  without having to reboot.

  ignored.
- The IMC2 ichat channel has been added as a default channel for
  creators in /secure/cmds/admins/encre.c
- The finger daemon no longer reports an incorrect birth year
  when queried repeatedly.
- Added commands: mudinfo, enemies, showgrid, whereis
- Quest-dependent advancement can be disabled in config.h by
  setting REQUIRE_QUESTING to 0.
- Automatic advancement (i.e. not having to go to Dirk) can
  be enabled by setting AUTO_ADVANCE to 1.
- Added "questrequired" and "autoadvance" to mudconfig command.
- The table of quest and experience points required for
  advancement is now maintained in PLAYERS_D, not Dirk.
- By default DS will now handle automatic advancement well beyond
  level 100. Note that there has been no balancing attempted
  beyond level 20. You will need to seriously adjust your mud's balance if
  you allow advancement past level 20.
- Bug fixed in quitting while invis.
- Added a cgi gateway to the built-in webserver that allows you
  to connect to the mud with a java client. To enable it:
  -----------------------
  mudconfig http port 8001
  mudconfig http disable
  mudconfig cgi enable
  mudconfig dirlist enable
  mudconfig creweb enable
  mudconfig http enable
  -----------------------
  Then use your browser to connect to your mud's connection page 
  (for example, http://your.muds.address.com:8001/cgi/connection.html )
  NOTE: the mud www port does not have to be 8001. Change it to
  whatever is appropriate for you.
- The dest verb now behaves like before. Desting of non-cloned
  objects by using their file names is again unsupported. This
  fixes problems with desting a singular among plurals.
- Some parsing issues in grenades fixed. They also do more
  damage, but are limited to hurting the first dozen or so people.
- Added a flash policy server. To enable, uncomment the flash_policy line
  in /secure/cfg/preload.cfg, redirect your mud server's port 843 to
  your mud port + 3 (for example 6669, if your mud is on 6666), 
  and reboot your mud. 
- Added MUDINFO_D to manage longterm intermud data (normal people 
  will not have any use for this).
- The answering machine now works again (when did this break??).
- Added ROOMS_D to keep track of the relative locations of rooms. This
  is necessary for some activities that will involve distances, such as vehicle
  combat in virtual areas.
- Added sefuns: coordinates(), calculate_coordinates(),
  room_environment(), query_windows()
- Some rooms have been moved around to accommodate conflicts with
  their coordinates.
- Only Firefox is supported with creweb. I can no longer afford to
  try to keep up with every browser's idea of how to conduct itself.
  If creweb isn't working and you aren't using Firefox, please use Firefox.
- The "noclip" command now accepts non-exit directions that have
  an entry in ROOMS_D as having a room adjacent.
- Books now do not individually hold their data, but rather cache and
  query with BOOK_D, to cut down on memory abuse and disk I/O costs.
- Fixed a bug in last_string_element() sefun that screwed up qcs doors.
- Added a zombie scroll to Oana's shop.
- General miscellaneous typo corrctions and minor bugfixes.
- Added Vega's SEASONS_D fixes.

---- 2.8.5 ---
- Liveupgrade only.
- Intermediate release to handle special liveupgrade issues.

---- 2.8.4 ---
- Released 2008-07-24
- Merged 2.9a8 into the 2.8.x line. Due to the importance of some
  security fixes, and since major changes have not yet been introduced
  in 2.9, the improvements of 2.9a8 (unreleased) and below are being
  folded into 2.8.
- Fixed odd door id problem reported by Tricky when warmbooting.
- Class data type removed from LIB_DOOR.
- Added commands: pwhere, vars
- Wizvision now lets creators see invisible creatures in a room.
- Accuracy and performance improvements to default parsing.
- Cleaned up and updated firearm code: targeting in a room full of
  corpses is improved. Wounds no longer inflict continuing damage,
  they simply interfere with player healing (NPC's heal normally).
  Unless you are skilled with firearms, shooting an npc over and
  over in rapid succession is extremely likely to miss.
- Fixed typo in PARTY_D.
- Healing is now largely dependent on whether you are hungry/thirsty,
  with some modifiers for relevant stats like strength, luck,
  and durability. Being asleep and drunk now actually do have a
  positive effect on healing, as well as having the "faith" skill.
  Overall this means healing *can* happen faster if you stay on
  top of these items and don't catch flying bullets. However, if
  you're not keeping fed and hydrated, healing will seem to have
  got slower.

- The call_out efun is now overridden with a sefun that checks
  for excessive call_outs and autoblacklists suspected problems. 
  To tune the number of permitted call_outs, modify the new 
  MAX_CALL_OUTS param in config.h. Note that objects in /secure and
  /daemon are exempted from this check.
- The update command no longer has a problem when you are mounted
  on a creature or vehicle.

  are still unsupported areas, just kept for historical reasons. They
  may eventually be dropped from the distribution.
- Driver: FluffOS updated to handle being compiled with DEBUG defined.
- Driver: Address server errors are now suppressed by default ( ADDRFAIL_NOTIFY 
  in comm.c )

  now work somewhat better.
- Taking over your char from a new session now logs in /log/enters.
- Added commands: warmboot, userload
- Windows users: FluffOS file operations tend to take a dramatically
  longer time to complete on Windows than on UNIX. A warmboot, while
  not disconnecting the users, may hang them for several minutes

  space or you will accelerate out of control. "boost" only, for example
  "boost +x+z" then to stop: "boost -x-z"
- Stargates added underwater and in outer space for convenient exploration.
  Beware fatal anoxia.

---- 2.7a12 ---

  large strings (e.g. "help modify").
- Bug in LIB_PAGER callback function fixed.
- Default reset interval is now 2 hours.
- Fixed a misleading message when giving multiple objects to an overloaded living.
- Added sample "pre-boobytrapped" objects: /domains/town/weap/boobytrap_dagger.c ,
  amd /domains/town/armor/boobytrap_ring.c
- Further fixes for conflicts in the shooting system.
- Fixed a problem with guest logins.

---- 2.5a23 ---
- Released 2007-11-09
- COMPAT BUSTER: Objects that used to inherit LIB_DUMMY for special
  invisible-but-manipulable functionality (see: http://dead-souls.net/ds-creator-faq.html#2.62 )
  now need to inherit LIB_BASE_DUMMY instead, to avoid nomask problems
  with shadow hooks.
- Fixes to shadows to better handle calls to nonexistent shadowed objects.
- Jade ring now autoprotects when worn, and cannot be worn by players unless they are
  in the TEST group.
- Most bearsuit bugs fixed. However, a disguised player can be detected by another clever
  player with some persistence and simple commands. The point is not foolproof
  anonymity, but a bit of fun. Creators can very easily detect disguised players
  using the command: scan here
- The grep command now prevents you from victimizing the mud with
  an excessive recurse.
- The clone command will now try to figure out a nearby matching object
  to clone if it doesn't find the file you specify.
- Ammunition and ammo case bugs fixed. 
- "cd ~-" and "cd -" will both now change to your previous working dir.

- Added verb: show
- Fixed verb/item conflict when two people in the same room try to shoot each other.
- The heal command now does a more thorough job of it.

- LIB_PAGER now uses mappings rather than classes, and been fixed a bit.

---- 2.5a21 ---
- Released 2007-11-05
- Improvements to router code.
- Added basic support for boobytraps. Verbs are: boobytrap and disarm. Lib

- Added sefun: roll()
- Tidied up get_object() to fail gracefully if necessary.
- New  or newly working lib objects/events: LIB_ROLL, LIB_DIE (for dice), LIB_VEHICLE
- Added sample vehicles in /domains/default/vehicles: hoverpod and strider
  Vehicles are still *experimental* and under development!
- The command showtree will now try to resolve the most sensible local object,
  if it can't find a file with the name you specify.
- Miscellaneous cleanup of loose tc()'s.

---- 2.5a18 ---
- Released 2007-10-27

  driver is now FluffOS.
- Compile time compat fixes added for Wolfpaw hosts.

---- 2.5a16 ---
- Released 2007-10-24
- FluffOS code altered to compile on Win32, but the included binary
  is still MudOS.
- Added Shadyman's updated Tim@TimMUD IMC2 code (see: help imc2 )
- Fixed very confusing behavior when adding a player-usable race
  with admintool if the race file was set to PLAYER_RACE.
- The users() sefun override now is optimized for FluffOS. It works

  for having the wrong password are now automatically removed
  from the blacklist after a set time (default 1 week).
- Router fix: a bug that had the router sending mudlist updates to the
  wrong muds has been fixed.

---- 2.5a13 ---
- Released 2007-10-12
- Removed command: where
- Modified users() sefun override to avoid a crasher under mysterious 
  circumstances.
- Added SEFUN_PLURALIZE to config.h, to allow the sefun override of
  the driver's pluralize() efun.

  64-bit Linux installs.

---- 2.5a12 ---
- Released 2007-06-24
- Nailed some really pesky router crashers involving null socket owner
  object references.
- Added sefuns: morse(), unmorse().
- Added an automatic Morse coder/decoder system to channels. To encode
  messages, make the first word of the message be: ^encode

---- 2.5a11 ---
- Released 2007-06-23
- Various broken table objects (eg the Orc Shaman's altar) fixed.
- The jade ring no longer makes reporting npc's invulnerable.

---- 2.5a8 ---
- Released 2007-06-15
- Added Set/GetMatching() to LIB_ID so that individual items
  can choose not to be "object matched".
- Intermud status sign should now work for reals.
- Added a shadow management system, so that objects can receive multiple
  shadows and remove them individually if necessary.
- New test character tool: /domains/default/armor/jade_ring.c allows you
  to receive detailed information about damage you receive, where, how
  much before protection, and how much after protection. It can also make
  you immune from damage, and can be used to force creatures to report
  their damage to you in a similar way.
- Added command: mem
- IRN tested and confirmed to work well with 4 nodes.
- Router fix: Sending a message on a channel a mud wasn't listening to now
  enables the channel for the mud *and* sends the message.
- Router fix: if a mud tries to connect with the same name as another
  mud, and from a different address, the currently connected mud is 
  notified. This serves two purposes: alerting a mud to a potential
  problem, and triggering a reset of the socket if it's actually zombied.

---- 2.5a7 ---
- Released 2007-06-02
- Improved IRN multi-peer support.
- Fixed various router runtimes and improved IRN data integrity.
- The bear costume now effectively disguises a player in most
  ways and they truly appear to be a bear. A shadow is used for this purpose.
- Modified driver to approach POSIX setitimer() compliance.
- 100% merged Windows and UNIX driver code.
- Added calendar information to the mudtime command.
- The race of a creature is now automatically added to its id array.
- Added ChangeLevel to sanely manage the advancement of skills
  and stats when a creature's level changes. The stat and skill "class"
  now dictates when stat and skill level is increased. When the
  new player level is divisible by 3, for example, and the stat class
  is three, then the stat is increased by 1.
- Added checks for TEST group membership to autosave and auto-quit.
- Implemented workaround to runtime error when moving into a room
  with many objects (caused by a buggy new parser feature).
- Fixed bug in /lib/body.c that caused an erroneous eventFall() where
  eventCollapse() was called for.

---- 2.4.2 ---
- Released 2007-04-23
- New subcommands added to liveupgrade: revert and alpha.
- Various security exposures mitigated.
- Fixed CanGet() bug in LIB_CHAIR (Thanks, K'Azdean).

  directories if needed.
- Fixed a bug in sample virtual areas that made travel nw, sw, or se take
  you to the wrong place.
- CALL_OUT_LOGGING has been reworked to be less vile and it now breaks
  few things, if any.
- Added an automapper. See: help automap
- Added Smaug area conversion utility, found in /secure/obj/converter_smaug.c
- A player's start room can now be a virtual room or a 
  cloned object (e.g. a mount).
- Fixed a problem with sending a string to eventDie() as an argument.
- Beefed up get_stack() sefun.
- Added virtual area to wiz labs for mounted combat testing.
- Added 3d virtual sky area to mounted combat arena.
- Fixed various problems with sky-based 3d virtual areas such as
  falling through multiple rooms, flying up more than one room, etc.
- The "source" command now takes the -q flag to indicate queuing, rather than
  immediate execution. This allows creators to be subject to the maximum
  number of commands per second limit but still be able use sourcing.
- The object matching code used to step on objects. For example, if your room had
  a "bar" as a SetItem, and a barstool as an inventory item, and OBJECT_MATCHING
  was enabled, then "exa bar" would actually return the barstool's long desc.
  This has now been fixed.
- The LastLocation property in players now handles cloned environments (e.g. mounts)
  and the return command also now deals with them correctly.
- Fixed a bug in eventDescribeEnvironment() that prevented riders from 
  seeing living creatures in a room when issuing the command: look
- Fixed bug in npc's that made mounted riders hear spoken messages more than once.
- Fixed another carry leak in containers. Containers now update their
  environments' CarriedMass.
- Fixed bug in LIB_BONUS that allowed the dropping/putting/getting of the 
  invisible bonus object.
- Fixed bug in LIB_POTION that failed to set the effect's duration.
- LIB_CLEAN will no longer dest inheritables in the /lib/ directory. This 
  avoids a situation where the inherits() efun returns confusing information.
- FILE_D now does a daily recompilation of the mud files list.
- Mounts are now set to resist room resets, so that one's loot doesn't
  get unloaded from memory just because they left their horse alone too long.
- The encre command now moves a player's estate to her creator homedir.
- The suicide command now removes a creator's directory or a player's estate
  and moves it to the /secure/save/decre directory.
- SetAttackable can now take a function as an argument. See /domains/town/npc/lars.c
  for an example.
- A bug in SetAttackable that allowed players to be attacked when a string
  was set as an argument is fixed.
- A bug in QCS that prevented deleting rooms with relative "customdefs" defines
  has been fixed.
- "restore here" now works.
- Fixed typo in Chapter 8 of the Admin Guide.

---- 2.4.1 ---
- Released 2007-03-21
- The display of obvious exits can be over the desc in brackets
  or under the desc in text form, depending on the NM_STYLE_EXITS 
  setting in config.h. This can be configured with: mudconfig nmexits [on|off]
- Added Diku-style equipment (eq) command.
- It's now possible to use two-letter emotes on channels, and one may
  use "channel:" syntax as well as "channelemote", eg: "cre: foo"
- Added age check to login for COPPA compliance (Technically this is
  not necessary since COPPA applies to commercial enterprises, but
  I'm adding it on general principle).
- Fixed nonsensical parsing bug in LIB_COMMAND.
- Liveupgrade will now create a dir if necessary.
- Rooms missing from /std added.

---- 2.4 ---
- Improved security in WGET_D.

---- 2.3a20 ---
- convert_ascii no longer uses a broken (and slow) lookup table. It 
  also now has a reverse counterpart, convert_into_ascii.
- Fixed a null array in LIB_MOUNT that hosed up some non-mount npc's.
- Added defaultdomain subcommand to the mudconfig command, so that
  you can make your new domain the default one for the mud with the 
  command: mudconfig defaultdomain /domains/MySpiffyArea
- The domaincreate command now adds all the rooms necessary to make a
  domain work as a default domain.
- Fixed a bug that allowed players to be attacked by other players
  despite PK and SetAttackable safeguards.
- Fixed a broken add_action in jennybot that emulated a broken verb.
- The liveupgrade command has been revamped to avoid a crasher (!!!) and 
  no longer requires multiple "liveupgrade all" entries. Just one will do.
- WGET_D is now throttled to prevent overwhelming the network.
- REMOTEPOST_D is now more aggressive about retiring old failed mail to avoid 
  idle OOB objects from constantly loading.
- Fixed bug in goto that broke using a string as an argument.

---- 2.3a19 ---
- Released 2007-03-13
- Further simplified parsing: it is no longer necessary to "put book on table" or
  "give sword to fighter". You can now "put book table" and "give sword fighter".
  Added to OLD_STYLE_PLURALS, COMMAND_MATCHING, and OBJECT_MATCHING, you can now
  issue brutish stuff like: "gi bo 2 fi 3" instead of "give the second book to the third fighter".
  The older syntax still works, of course.
- To emulate Diku behavior, the lib will now accept number.object syntax, eg: "gi 2.bo 3.fi"
- Fixed an excessively ugly error message generated by issuing certain non-alphabetic characters as the
  first char in a command.
- Fixed a parsing bug in OLD_STYLE_PLURALS that tried to incorrectly index the command line array.
- The commands goto and people have been updated to handle mounted players.
- Events that occur on mounts are now properly communicated to the mount's environment,
  and vice versa.
- When your mount engages in combat, the messages are no longer confusing.
- Fixed last major obstacle to http liveupgrades. Files should no longer get mangled in-transit.

---- 2.3a18 ---
- Released 2007-03-12
- If OLD_STYLE_PLURALS is defined in config.h, commands will be translated
  from "drop book 2" format to "drop 2nd book" format automatically.
- Added SetNoCondition() to living things. If you don't like indications of
  health on an npc, make it SetNoCondition(1) and its health status will not
  report on looking at it. This will also work on players. If you want this to
  be the default behavior for players, add a call to SetNoCondition in connect.c.
- Added Set/GetAttackable to LIB_LIVING, so that npc's can be made immune
  to players' standard attacks. Note that your mud may still contain special
  weapons or spells that can trick the npc into fighting, so you may also want to
  set the npc to not pick fights, using SetPacifist(1)
- Names of invis players are now scrambled when they make rwho requests,
  so that the target mud does not know who has queried it.
- Invis admins now correctly receive pings/tells/rwho's/etc.
- When mounted, you can now "ride s" rather than "ride south".
- The copy verb now deals with custom defines more sanely.
- It is now possible to create rooms not linked to anything, with the create command.
  Example: create room none newroom1.c
- The decre command no longer freezes the target.
- Ping daemon does not try to ping when intermud is disabled.
- Added sefuns: convert_newline, clean_newline_file, to deal with http file corruption.
- WGET_D now correctly handles receipt of newlines in files.

---- 2.3a15 ---
- The liveupgrade command has a check now so that trying to "liveupgrade apply" while
  downloads are in progress will fail.
- Unique objects are now dropped when a player leaves the game whether or
  not the mud is set to default inventory retention.
- The sefun print_long_string() now deletes its temp file when done.
- Mounts updated and improved: short and long  descs include riders, room messages are relayed
  to riders, and riders can be examined, among other enhancements. Some messages, such
  as combat messages, are still a little confusing.
- The initfix verb now fails reasonably for virtual rooms.
- Non-meat creatures behave somewhat more sensibly now when shot.
- Fixed a null cwd error on first admin login.
- It is now possible to force room inventory to respawn every X seconds. By passing an
  array in SetInventory, an item can be respawned if it is missing. See the example
  in /domains/default/room/wiz_hall.c , which is set to check every 10 seconds to
  see if the tree is there. If it is not, it will respawn one copy of it.
- The who command no longer counts Pinkfish code in its character count for title length,
  so you may have a diferent color for every letter of your 50 character long title,
  if you absolutely positively MUST.
- Added a LIB_BANK as a wrapper for tellers, like LIB_SHOP for vendors. It's now possible
  to just "balance" and "deposit all" rather than "ask zoe for balance" and "ask zoe to
  deposit all".
- Added command "speakcolor" to set the color in which you receive spoken messages (if,
  for example, you dislike people saying things in cyan).

---- 2.3a14 ---
- Fixed runtime in lead/follow code with SetEnters.
- Fixed bug that prevented followers from following through a SetEnter.
- Made some important changes to the liveupgrade system to handle
  unusual exceptions.

---- 2.3a13 ---
- The liveupgrade command now defaults to http connections to the dead-souls.net site,
  which is orders of magnitude faster and more secure than oob, as well as more
  reliable and efficient.
- Implemented shutdown packet in router. If the delay time is less than
  7 days, it just disconnects the mud. Otherwise it deletes the mud's info.
- Router connections with a sufficiently large number of password failures
  are automatically blacklisted.
- Removed muds are now properly synced on IRN.
- Intermud passwords now use 9 digits.
- Dead Souls now handles Tricky's ping-req and ping-reply packets.
- Network room is less spammy on reconnects.
- Arch/wiz room intermud status is now updated in realtime. The status indicated is always current.
- Fixed chanlist problem in router.
- MAX_COMMANDS_PER_SECOND now also applies to creators.
- Modified router and router command to add functionality. See: help router
- Router now periodically sifts through sockets and discards router sockets
  not currently associated with a connected mud.
- Fixed problem in validate() in PLAYERS_D.

---- 2.3a11 ---
- Replying to intermud mail now works.
- Fixed spurious error message in mudconfig command.
- Added basic Inter Router Networking support to router code.
- Fixed bizarre exit message if you're not standing and you go home.

---- 2.3a10 ---
- Released 2007-02-15
- Added intermud mail support.
- Fixed $P in prompt.
- Added security fixes to router.
- Abstracted the connection code from the everything-else code in the
  router, so that modifications can be made without having to drop muds.
- Moved people command to /secure so admins can see each other.
- Invis admins no longer generate connection messages when logging in or out.
- Fixed mv command.
- Creators can now sleep.
- Telling to a sleeping person now generates a warning.

---- 2.3a9 ---
- Released 2007-01-30
- Fixed bug that prevented players who idled out while editing from
  being booted.
- Sending a tell to an NPC no longer runtimes.
- Closed up various exploit vectors with overrides of efuns.
- Null groups no longer hose MASTER_D.
- Fixed spurious error message in mv command.
- Added the "prompt" command, with which you can now customize dynamic prompts.
- Added wimpy status to env command.
- Fixed some bugs and an exploit in mail code.
- Creators can no longer snoop by default. To make snooping available
  to a creator, add her to the SNOOPER group. She will then be able to snoop
  players, but not creators. To let her snoop creators, you'll need to
  promote her to assistant admin, or edit valid_snoop() in /secure/sefun/sefun.c .
- Added inews to the default creator channel list.
- Fixed grievous carry leak in containers.
- Fixed some null error messages when default parsing is enabled.
- Fixed a runtime with default parsing enabled.
- Fixed error message when giving something to an overloaded creature.
- Added verbs: activate, deactivate, install, uninstall.

- Added wrist computer as an example of an object that has functions
  added to it without shadows. See /domains/default/armor/wristcomp.c
  and /domains/default/obj/module_cloak.c
- Only one LIB_OOB ob is created for a full liveupgrade.
- You can now do a liveupgrade from behind a firewall: opening
  your oob port is no longer necessary.
- Fixed flashlight bug.
- Fixed elevator button/dummy object bug.
- System channels are added to players on login if they're missing. This
  corrects a problem with login announcements on upgraded muds.
- First admin logins now may choose between four genders.
- Shortest command matching is now shortest *unique* command matching, to
  avoid accidentally executing the wrong command.
- Added OBJECT_MATCHING, COMMAND_MATCHING, BARE_EXITS, and
  LIVEUPGRADE_SERVER to mudconfig command.
- The wizlist command generates an updated cre list regardless of whether
  the mud is upgraded or at its native rev.
- Implemented LIB_ROOM fix suggested by Memrosh.

---- 2.3a5 ---
- Released 2007-01-19
- Added OOB support.
- Added liveupgrade system. See: help liveupgrade

---- 2.3a1 ---
- Released 2006-12-29
- Fixed null errors in wield verb.
- DEFAULT_PARSING now works correctly. If you have two keys and two tables,
  "put key on table" will put a key on a table without causing
  an "ambiguous parsing" error.
- Added sefuns: atomize_string, atomize_array.
- Setting OBJECT_MATCHING in /secure/include/config.h to 1 will enable
  "shortest matching name" behavior, so that "zap di" is equivalent
  to "zap dirk".
- Setting COMMAND_MATCHING in /secure/include/config.h to 1 will enable
  "shortest matching command" behavior, so that "upd here" is equivalent
  to "update here".
- Added command: qed.
- Setting BARE_EXITS in /secure/include/config.h to 1 will now let you
  use "north" and "cabin" as valid movement commands, rather than "go north"
  and "enter cabin".
- "afk" property is now removed on login.
- Extra description strings from GetAffectLong() no longer duplicate if
  you're carrying multiples of an item.
- Modified races so that non-meat lifeforms don't leave rotting meat corpses.
- Added passive-mode support to ftp server ( contributed by Duuk @ Haven ).
- Added code to prevent "bad alternate router data" bug that tends
  to knock muds off the router.
- Added "neutral" (aka hermaphrodite, aka intersex) and "none" to 
  user-selectable gender choices (Not applicable to first admin).
- Lower case mudlib names now work in mudlist.
- Probability lab bugs have been fixed. Charly and Charles now save
  their persistent data in a sensible way.
- "copy /obj/room.c" now works for non-admins.
- Fixed up some issues with the dsversion command.
- Added sefun: chunk_string(), groups(), query_intermud_ip().
- Added commands: wizlock, wizunlock, wizlist.
- Added commands: gag, mute.
- Fixed another paradox condition in the router where a mud could be
  simultaneously connected AND disconnected, causing reconnection problems.
  A periodic check for this condition will clear it every 15 minutes or so.
- Added command: flee.
- New creators are polyglottized by default.
- inet, ftp, http, and rcp services can now be configured with mudconfig.
- The router room is now the server monitoring room. Admins may now use
  that room selectively to monitor traffic on the following services:
  ftp, http, rcp, i3 (router). They can be monitored in any combination,
  and the messages are in different colors to help distinguish between them
  when multiple service monitoring occurs.
- The netstat command now lists the correct FD's.
- Reverted default MALLOC to something that fancy new 64 bit computers like.
- Retooled inet/server subsystem to accommodate RCP, added creremote
  and LIB_REMOTE to the extra/ dir of the distribution, as well as instructions.
- Recompiled Windows driver to match current unix standard config.
- Finally (I hope) nailed that pesky router connection problem.
- Fixed bug in LIB_LOCK that prevented carried, lockable objects from working right.
- "unsnoop" and "unsnoop all" now work.
- Cleaned unwatched players from "snoopreport".
- /log/catch messages now have time stamps.
- Fixed errors/typos in groupmod and mudconfig help text.
- There is an error in the help file for groupmod. It should look like this:
  Syntax: groupmod [-a|-r] GROUP NAME 
          groupmod [-c|-d] GROUP
- Fixed a bug in grep that made it choke and halt on binary files. It still
  chokes, but it continues grepping after reporting the runtime.
- "decre" no longer removes all channels. Note that testing encre and
  decre repeatedly on the same character will probably generate problems eventually.
- Added LOCAL_TIME parameter to config.h. Some OS'es use UTC and offsets for
  timekeeping, others use a "local time" setting. Rather than try to play offset
  games and fail miserably, this setting is meant to address that.
- Added "mudconfig" command to enable the convenient changing of some config.h parameters.
- LIB_CONNECT now checks CFG_IP_UNRESTRICT as well as SAME_IP_MAX to determine
  if the connection should be permitted. This allows you to specify ip's that
  are immune from "max connection" restrictions. 
- LIB_CONNECT now checks each incoming connection to determine whether it
  is the last known ip of a SECURE user. If it is, the connection
  is permitted regardless of SAME_IP_MAX.
- It is now possible to use the "home" command to go to other
  creators' workrooms.
- GetPlayerList(), GetCreatorList(), and GetUserList() in PLAYERS_D can now be trusted
  to provide correct information (for new installs).
- It is now possible to get player data from users that are logged off, by specifying the variable
  to the player daemon. For example: eval return PLAYERS_D->GetPlayerData("cratylus","Properties")
- Beefed up groupmod to handle group adding/deleting, and enable (some) use by ASSIST.
- Added command: groupmod.
- Added commands: pause, unpause. Used to remove/restore commands
  from a player with behavior problems.
- Recurring reboots can now be disabled in config.h with DISABLE_REBOOTS.
- Added command "chancolors" to toggle seeing colored channel messages. This is
  to limit the annoyingness of people who add pinkfish color codes
  to their channel messages.
- Fixed a problem in LIB_SHOOT that prevented targeting specific
  victims, as well as a runtime bug when shooting things in your inventory.
- Fixed a runtime in CHAT_D that mishandled unknown chans.
- If EVENTS_LOGGING is set in config.h, new events added to the
  EVENTS_D will be logged to /log/secure/events.
- If CALL_OUT_LOGGING is set in config.h, call_outs not created by
  privileged objects are logged (There shouldn't be any need to
  log call_outs initiated from within /secure). call_outs originating
  in /daemon are not logged either, due to the size of the resulting
  log growing too quickly.
- Initiating flight while resting on furniture no longer corrupts
  a creature's short desc.
- Fixed bug where "look at thing on blah" let you look at
  the thing even if it was invis.

- Fixed problem with out-of-sequence messages using TalkResponse 
  in sentients.

- Fixed bug in router code that created problems when muds
  originating from the same ip connected and reconnected.

  pk, find, chanremove, chancreate.

- mudos.cfg now has a time to swap value of 0, to disable
  swapping. I've seen now more than one driver crash due to
  a swap bug, and I'm not sure what the problem is, so until I do
  know, swapping will be disabled by default.
- Added RELOAD_D for objects that need to somehow get
  themselves reloaded without incurring recursion problems.
- ROUTER_D now resets every 25 hours or so.
- The banish command now has an "-s" option to banish offensive
  substrings from names.

  snooping yourself using your capitalized name.
- "X looks around" and "checks possessions" messages are now suppressed
  in meeting rooms.
- Fixed reporting of object mass so that both the mass of the container
  and its contents are returned. This corrects a LIB_MOUNT error.
- Fixed archaic parse_* lines in some verbs that interfered with VERBS_D.

  swim, and what they breathe.
- New daemon: FILE_D, traverses the lib hierarchy, compiles
  a list of all files, and maintains the cached data for querying.
  Full refreshes of the data happen relatively quickly, in under
  a minute, and does not lag the mud much.
- New daemon: FUNCTION_D, uses FILE_D to determine inheritable lib
  filenames, then queries each for the names of functions defined.
  Full refreshes of this data happen slowly, several minutes
  or longer. However, the mud is not much lagged during this process
  except while processing very large files (e.g. /lib/body.c).
- Fixed "first admin bug" that failed to add channels.
- Implemented emotes bugfix provided by Aransus.

- Fixed problem on i3 router that caused muds to share fd's.
- Added MAX_COMMANDS_PER_SECOND to config.h to enable a cap on scripters.
  This affects players only.

  now be filled at the town's riverbank and at the shore.
- Added verbs: pour, fill, empty.
- Removed encre/decre from admintool. It was goofy and dangerous.
- Added SetActionsMap() to LIB_ROOM, to enable room actions with variable
  frequencies. The old SetAction() method also still works.
- Added RETAIN_ON_QUIT define in config.h, and SetRetain() and GetRetain()
  to LIB_PERSIST. Any object that returns 1 on GetRetain() is retained
  across logons, regardless of RETAIN_ON_QUIT. Any object that return 0
  on GetRetain() is removed on quit, regardless of RETAIN_ON_QUIT. Changing
  RETAIN_ON_QUIT requires a reload of every object, or a restart of the mud.

- It is now possible to mudlist, rwho, and tell to a mud using its
  ip address+port. For example: rwho 71.234.154.99 6666
- The muffing commands now also affect tells. "earmuff Tatianna" will
  prevent you from hearing channel messages *and* tells from tatianna.
  You can also muff ip address + port, example:
  earmuff @194.70.3.211 3000
- "tell history" now provides a limited history of your tell messages.

  fewer than 3 existing currencies.

  is set as their default language.

  It is left as an example of game code, but you are warned that
  it contains some subtle and not-so-subtle errors in its calculations.
o addr_server.exe win32 binary removed, due to bugginess. Since
  it hasn't been working for a while, and it was only noticed by
  a bugtester, it's going away until post-2.1
o A peculiarity in grammar with multiple corpses can be seen. This is
  partly due to a MudOS idiosyncracy which will be addressed in the future.
o In some cases combat events appear slighly out of order. This
  will be addressed in a rewrite of combat objects in the future.

  player receives an "unknowingly tells you" message.
- Intermud channels can be disabled by toggling 
  RESTRICTED_INTERMUD in /secure/include/config.h. Exceptions
  to this restriction can be made by adding users to
  the INTERMUD group using admintool.
- Automatic promotion of new characters to creator status can
  be enabled by editing /secure/include/config.h and 
  toggling AUTO_WIZ.
- Update and runtime errors now attempt to display more helpful
  messages to the user, if the user is a creator (Thx, Brodbane).
- Error logs now include timestamps.
- Added trainers to QCS.
- *COMPAT BUSTER*: Trainer skills now have to be specified with
  an array, not just a series of strings:
  RIGHT: AddTrainingSkills( ({ "alpha", "bravo", "charlie" }) );
  WRONG: AddTrainingSkills( "alpha", "bravo", "charlie" );
- Fixed error message bug in /lib/trainer.c.
- Fixed chat.c bug that allowed emotes from earmuffed players
  to be printed.

- Added IDLE_TIMEOUT to /secure/include/config.h
- Added sefuns: imud_privp, find_inheritors, find_deep_inheritors,
  securep.
- Overhauled limb and corpse decay. DECAY_D now handles the
  callouts, reducing the number of decaying callouts to 1, regardless
  of the number of limbs and corpses lying about.

  in chapter 35 of the Creator's Manual.

- Additional docs, helpfiles, updated faqs and expanded QCS chapters.

---- 2.0r13 ---
- Numerous minor fixes to commands and lib objects.
- Keepalive daemon implemented to detect when the intermud
  connection is down and attempts to restart it.
- Intermud services now supports "auth" packets, somewhat.
- The bk command now also works on objects.
- Added commands: kills, chanban, chanunban, earmuff, unmuff.
- Fixed duplicate handbook bug in encre.
- New cres are no longer forced to quit.
- Fixed parser bug when dealing with identical items in different
  containers.
- Added sefuns: query_names, answers_to, add_event, remove_event, 
  update, local_ctime.
- Fixed events system (see *_event sefuns).
- Non-admins now can't use the dest or trans commands on admins. Note that
  if a creator really wants to, she could get around using the commands and
  trans or dest you anyway. However, now they can't do it "accidentally".
- The bull shark is no longer drinkable.
- Applied workaround to an apostrophe bug. Full fix pending.
- More sefun documentation.

---- 2.0r12 ---
- Release 2006-01-30

---- 2.0r11 ---
- Added findobs sefun and findobj command.
- Fixed "no steal" item property so thieves can't steal such things.
- Android corpses and severed limbs now decay in their own special way.
- Fixed up the sample flu and cold so they don't permanently affect a 
  a player's stats. Added a very nasty rage virus.
- Ftpd and httpd now work (Thanks to Duuk @ Haven). To enable them, uncomment
  inet in /secure/cfg/preload.cfg. They are UNSUPPORTED, and if they ruin
  your life, it's not my problem. System security is on you.
- Added valid_link() to master.c so that link() efun works. An interactive,
  privileged, nonforced object is required in the previous_object() stack
  to avoid abuse. Do NOT use this functionality unless you know EXACTLY
  what you're doing. It probably doesn't work the way you think it does.
  Be especially careful not to link privileged files to directories that
  unprivileged users have write access to. Windows users should just 
  forget they read any of this.
- Verbified dest command. Peculiar "desting of nonexistent things" bug
  should be dead at long last.
- Golems can have their composition specified. As an example, the combat
  dummy is now a wood golem.
- Creatures born without limbs are now able to fight while in their
  natural prone position. Creatures who used to have limbs and no longer
  do have more limited options.
- SetUnique() now does what common sense requires.

- Fixed channels bug that changed lognames if someone was listening
  to a channel. Now both log.

- Added light meter to creators' chest.

- Added numerous new directives to QCS.
- Added lib object check and NoModify checks to QCS verbs.

  no longer accept or manipulate objects. If a creator somehow
  manages to lose both hands they can use the "heal" command to fully
  restore themselves.

  menagerie of sample npc's for testing.
- Fixed stealing system, added thief class.

- Modified wrap() sefun to output truncated text rather than just
  error out when buffer overflows.
- Added arch command.
- Added EXTRA_TIME_OFFSET parameter to /secure/include/config.h to
  accommodate OS'es with peculiar timekeeping.
- Changed local_options to avoid excessive warning messages in /log/errors.
  This is only useful if doing a new install of Dead Souls, or
  if you copy local_options from the full distribution and recompile
  the driver. For the Windows version, all that is needed is to
  copy the new driver.exe over the old one, if you're doing an upgrade.
- Rescue login feature added. If when you try to log in, everything
  goes to hell, try logging in adding "_rescue" to your name, which
  in my case is: cratylus_rescue
- For admins, eval now writes the temp file to /secure, to avoid 
  annoying /realms dir permission conflicts.
- Cleaned up goto and dest command ugliness.
- Modified reload command and reload() sefun not to perform recursive
  updates by default. This should speed up QCS response time and cut
  down on mud-wide lag.

- Fixed QCS bug that prevented barkeeps from having stuff added
  to their inventories.
- Made it harder to join the mages (The game is too hard for a
  first level mage).
- Fixed a bug that made Herkimer a cheat.
- Applied workaround for a bug in Clepius.
