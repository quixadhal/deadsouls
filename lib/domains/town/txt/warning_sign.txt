WARNING!

This area is Kaliid. It is part of the old,
broken version of Dead Souls. It has been mostly unbroken,
so that for example the desert and bank roof work properly.

However, you will note obvious differences in design
between Kaliid and the main sample town. Remember, neither
Kaliid nor the town are intended to *be* a mud.
They are only examples of places and things that you can
examine to guide you in building your own mud.
