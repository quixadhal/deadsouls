[27Feb2006-10:45:43] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> how are you all today
[27Feb2006-10:46:13] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> swell
[27Feb2006-10:47:15] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i've managed to endup with 4 unique monsters again, i think i must be doing something wrong with the set_unique flag :(

[27Feb2006-22:08:13] Cratylus <ds> it's a line that dead souls muds listen in on
[27Feb2006-22:08:24] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> thanks
[27Feb2006-22:08:28] Cratylus <ds> no prob
[28Feb2006-12:33:57] Cratylus <ds> hiya admin
[28Feb2006-12:34:11] Cratylus <ds> you can use this channel to ask questions, if you run into problems
[28Feb2006-12:34:25] Cratylus <ds> it's a channel dead souls muds listen to
[28Feb2006-15:27:11] Cratylus <ds> heya odin
[28Feb2006-15:27:27] Cratylus <ds> use this line for questions if you run into trouble
[28Feb2006-15:42:15] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Crat: You're a lawyer?
[28Feb2006-15:42:33] Cratylus <ds> am i that much of a jerk?
[28Feb2006-15:42:51] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> What use are you when I get into trouble then.
[28Feb2006-15:43:13] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> I saw the best notice the other day. It said "No solicitors."
[28Feb2006-15:43:19] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> yesterday
[28Feb2006-15:43:52] Cratylus <ds> good thing it didnt say no solicitation
[28Feb2006-15:43:58] Cratylus <ds> or is that the trouble?
[28Feb2006-15:44:10] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> well, in England, a solicitor is like a lawyer.
[28Feb2006-15:44:14] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> soliciting is something else
[28Feb2006-15:44:18] Cratylus <ds> :)
[28Feb2006-15:46:14] <dead_souls> Arren@OuterSpace goes back to A2.
[28Feb2006-15:46:58] Cratylus <ds> sorry i couldnt be of help
[28Feb2006-15:47:04] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> heh
[28Feb2006-15:47:09] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> we don't get this channel on A2.
[28Feb2006-15:47:13] Cratylus <ds> still, i'd be happy to hear all about your legal trouble
[28Feb2006-15:47:27] Cratylus <ds> liven things up around here
[28Feb2006-15:47:31] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Well, when we got to talking, the policeman was very nice.
[28Feb2006-15:47:37] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> and we went back to his place
[28Feb2006-15:48:45] Arren@OuterSpace <dead_souls> it gets boring after that
[28Feb2006-15:49:03] Cratylus <ds> better luck next time
[28Feb2006-15:49:33] <dead_souls> Arren@OuterSpace snuggles with Cratylus.
[28Feb2006-15:49:45] Cratylus <ds> w00t

[28Feb2006-15:52:54] Cratylus <ds> well yer always so mean to me
[28Feb2006-15:53:04] Cratylus <ds> i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop
[28Feb2006-23:01:03] Cratylus <ds> hiya kirian

[28Feb2006-23:01:21] Kirian@13 Kingdoms <dead_souls> thanks :-)
[28Feb2006-23:01:53] Kirian@13 Kingdoms <dead_souls> just figuring out the mudlib to decide on if we are going with it or not :) probably be asking questions tommorow when i've had chance to play around a bit :)
[28Feb2006-23:02:07] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[01Mar2006-14:35:26] Cratylus <ds> hi shemp
[01Mar2006-14:35:34] Cratylus <ds> if you have questions about dead souls, use this line
[01Mar2006-15:46:43] Cratylus <ds> ah abby. long time no see
[01Mar2006-18:40:09] Abby@Fading Summer <dead_souls> Hey hey.
[01Mar2006-18:56:16] A shadow <ds> :)
[01Mar2006-19:13:26] Abby@Fading Summer <dead_souls> Hmm, invis over the ds comm....
[01Mar2006-19:13:30] Abby@Fading Summer <dead_souls> Tsk tsk. ;)
[01Mar2006-19:39:23] Cratylus <ds> yeh
[01Mar2006-19:39:26] Cratylus <ds> accident
[01Mar2006-19:39:38] Cratylus <ds> was in the middle of trying not to get hassled by orcs
[01Mar2006-20:10:15] Cratylus <ds> :)
[01Mar2006-21:39:40] Cratylus <ds> howdy arnold
[01Mar2006-21:39:50] Cratylus <ds> use this line for questions n stuff
[02Mar2006-19:05:10] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> where would I edit to change how long someone can be idle before they get disconnected?
[02Mar2006-19:07:23] Cratylus <ds> /lib/secure/include/config.h
[02Mar2006-19:07:35] Cratylus <ds> LOGON_TIMEOUT
[02Mar2006-19:07:53] Cratylus <ds> oh wait thats not what you asked
[02Mar2006-19:07:59] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> thanks!
[02Mar2006-19:08:13] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> ah
[02Mar2006-19:09:07] Cratylus <ds> /lib/player.c line 47
[02Mar2006-19:09:19] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> thanks
[02Mar2006-19:09:35] Cratylus <ds> though that really should be in config.h. I'll put it there in a later release
[02Mar2006-19:10:16] Cratylus <ds> you know you can change your mud name in admintool, right?
[02Mar2006-19:11:48] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> ahh, didnt notice that before.  If I shutdown the mud will it boot back up?  Or do I have to do that through my shell account?
[02Mar2006-19:12:06] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> you're on linux?
[02Mar2006-19:12:50] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> Not right now, but the mud is, and I have a shell account I can log into from here.
[02Mar2006-19:13:07] Cratylus <ds> if you're on unix and you used the bin/startmud script then the mud should bounce back up.
[02Mar2006-19:13:17] Cratylus <ds> otherwise you'll need to restart it manually
[02Mar2006-19:13:35] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> ah, I did ./driver ./mudos.cfg
[02Mar2006-19:13:47] Cratylus <ds> then you'll need to do it again after shutting down
[02Mar2006-19:13:55] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> k
[02Mar2006-19:14:29] Kristus@Dead_Souls_kristus <dead_souls> so if I do ./startmud ./mudos.cfg it will auto boot upon shutdown?
[02Mar2006-19:14:39] Cratylus <ds> no
[02Mar2006-19:15:03] Cratylus <ds> edit startmud so that export MUDHOME="" has your mud dir in it
[02Mar2006-19:15:23] Cratylus <ds> for example: export MUDHOME="/home/kristus/ds"
[02Mar2006-19:15:37] Cratylus <ds> then just type: ./startmud
[02Mar2006-19:18:40] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> there we go
[02Mar2006-22:19:15] Skout@Bragi's Song <dead_souls> Greets all
[02Mar2006-22:19:21] Cratylus <ds> howdy!
[02Mar2006-22:20:13] Skout@Bragi's Song <dead_souls> congratz on a nice mudlib, I am just finished with the install which was by far the easiest mudos based install I have done.
[02Mar2006-22:20:39] Cratylus <ds> thanks :)
[02Mar2006-22:30:04] Merlin@Pirates' Mud <dead_souls> Hello
[02Mar2006-22:30:18] Merlin@Pirates' Mud <dead_souls> yeah this mudlib rocks
[02Mar2006-22:30:32] Merlin@Pirates' Mud <dead_souls> QCS is pretty nifty
[02Mar2006-22:31:25] Cratylus <ds> glad it's useful
[02Mar2006-22:31:33] Cratylus <ds> please let me know if you run into bugs
[02Mar2006-23:43:28] Merlin@Pirates' Mud <dead_souls> definitely
[02Mar2006-23:44:07] Merlin@Pirates' Mud <dead_souls> actually using v22.2b14 right now there is a b15 now right?
[03Mar2006-05:56:38] Cratylus <ds> b14 is the last supported mudos i'm aware of
[03Mar2006-12:04:52] Cratylus <ds> hi kurgan
[03Mar2006-12:05:04] Cratylus <ds> this line is for asking dead souls questions n stuff
[03Mar2006-15:00:01] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> you there, cratylus?
[03Mar2006-15:00:13] A shadow <ds> yep
[03Mar2006-15:00:21] Cratylus <ds> whats up?
[03Mar2006-15:01:07] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> I got a fatal error (illegal size read from swap file).  How can I prevent this?
[03Mar2006-15:01:29] Cratylus <ds> this error is happening when you start the mud?
[03Mar2006-15:02:56] Cratylus <ds> ...
[03Mar2006-15:07:35] Cratylus <ds> ok
[03Mar2006-15:07:45] Cratylus <ds> ok
[03Mar2006-17:47:52] Cratylus <ds> we're back
[04Mar2006-05:20:32] Noose@Dead_Souls_noose <dead_souls> tissi

[04Mar2006-07:32:01] Cratylus <ds> finnish is a frustrating language to me
[04Mar2006-07:32:13] Cratylus <ds> i just cannot make heads or tails of it
[04Mar2006-07:32:29] Noose@Utajaervi MUD <dead_souls> x)
[04Mar2006-07:33:48] Cratylus <ds> i know a bunch of european languages, so i can usually decipher the general idea of a european language, even if i dont know it. but if there are white people talking and i cannot understand one single word they say, it's either finnish or hungarian
[04Mar2006-07:35:04] Cratylus <ds> only finnish i know is "haista vittu"
[04Mar2006-07:35:18] Noose@Utajaervi MUD <dead_souls> that's a good start
[04Mar2006-07:35:38] Cratylus <ds> i thought you might appreciate it
[04Mar2006-07:35:44] Noose@Utajaervi MUD <dead_souls> hahahah
[04Mar2006-07:44:03] Tijntje@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Finnish and hungarian are related, IIRC.
[04Mar2006-07:45:29] Cratylus <ds> yep
[04Mar2006-07:45:59] Cratylus <ds> estonian is supposed to be similar
[04Mar2006-07:48:04] Cratylus <ds> oh i also cant decipher any basque
[05Mar2006-18:15:17] Deminix@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> huh?
[05Mar2006-18:15:21] Cratylus <ds> :)
[05Mar2006-18:15:40] Cratylus <ds> this line is for questions n stuff, if you run into trouble with the dead souls lib
[05Mar2006-18:16:04] Deminix@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> My appologies. Thanks!
[05Mar2006-18:16:10] Cratylus <ds> no prob
[05Mar2006-18:17:38] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Ah, nifty
[05Mar2006-18:20:39] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Sorry, we're both kinda tards on this
[05Mar2006-18:21:47] Cratylus <ds> well, everyones a newbie sometime
[05Mar2006-18:22:07] Cratylus <ds> dead souls is designed to be good for advanced admins, but friendly to newbies too
[05Mar2006-18:22:26] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Definately been easier then some of the others
[05Mar2006-18:22:26] Cratylus <ds> if you run into bugs and stuff, please let me know
[05Mar2006-18:23:32] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> heh, thanks
[05Mar2006-18:24:30] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> What channels are available
[05Mar2006-18:25:00] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Sorry, I'm a bit of a putz
[05Mar2006-18:25:02] Cratylus <ds> well as a noob, this is the only channel you should use for a while. but there is also intergossip and intercre
[05Mar2006-18:25:16] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Well, within the mud I mean, sorry
[05Mar2006-18:25:24] Cratylus <ds> i discourage people from using intergossip, because it is extremely hostile to newcomers
[05Mar2006-18:25:33] Cratylus <ds> oh. type: lines
[05Mar2006-18:25:37] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> lines
[05Mar2006-18:25:41] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> whoops
[05Mar2006-18:25:43] Cratylus <ds> heh
[05Mar2006-18:25:51] Deminix@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Thanks Cratylus
[05Mar2006-18:25:55] Cratylus <ds> no prob
[05Mar2006-18:25:57] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> Sorry, Man, I'm showin my newbiness
[05Mar2006-18:26:07] Cratylus <ds> better here than intergossip i assure you
[05Mar2006-18:26:13] Jerin@Dead_Souls_jerin <dead_souls> lol
[05Mar2006-18:26:45] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> hey cratylus...I want to add a setting in the player file that determines which plane of existence someone is on.  Each plane will have altered commands and descriptions for objects and rooms.  Each object file will have the data for each plane of existence contained in one file, and the SetLong, SetShort, etc will point to a function that determines which state they are in and changes its value accordingly.  What do you think would be the best method of doing this?
[05Mar2006-18:27:21] Cratylus <ds> well the Right Way involves adding SetPlane() and GetPlane() methods to the player object
[05Mar2006-18:27:47] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> /lib/player.c?
[05Mar2006-18:27:47] Cratylus <ds> see SetRace() for how this works
[05Mar2006-18:27:49] Cratylus <ds> ya
[05Mar2006-18:28:31] Cratylus <ds> the lazy way is to SetProperty("plane","blah") but that should be used only temporarily, if at all
[05Mar2006-18:28:42] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> yeah
[05Mar2006-18:29:06] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> when you say to see SetRace()...where am I looking for this reference at?
[05Mar2006-18:29:14] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> in player.c?
[05Mar2006-18:29:22] Cratylus <ds> heh yeah that's not actually in player.c is it
[05Mar2006-18:29:32] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> dont think so
[05Mar2006-18:29:48] Cratylus <ds> i think SetRace() is in /lib/race.c
[05Mar2006-18:30:04] Cratylus <ds> anyway, dont forget what i'm abotu to tell you:
[05Mar2006-18:30:32] Cratylus <ds> to make your PlayerPlane variable save in each players playerfile, you must add it to the AddSave line in player.c
[05Mar2006-18:31:02] Cratylus <ds> what you're doing is adding a variable to the player object, but if it isn't an AddSave, it won't persist across logons
[05Mar2006-18:31:59] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> ahhh, thanks
[05Mar2006-18:34:21] Cratylus <ds> i suggest you start with just one plane aside from the normal default plane, so you can get an idea of the complexity involved
[05Mar2006-18:58:57] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> is there a reason why apostrophes were stripped in communication?
[05Mar2006-19:00:57] Cratylus <ds> heh
[05Mar2006-19:01:03] Cratylus <ds> that's a bug
[05Mar2006-19:01:14] Cratylus <ds> i'll fix it for the next release
[05Mar2006-19:01:28] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> I already fixed it on mine :p
[05Mar2006-19:01:36] Cratylus <ds> right on
[05Mar2006-19:02:16] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> there was a replace_string() function.  How is that a bug?  Seems like thats the way it was meant to be.
[05Mar2006-19:02:30] Cratylus <ds> it's a bug that it happens on comms
[05Mar2006-19:02:42] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> ahh
[05Mar2006-19:02:50] Cratylus <ds> basically stripping apostrophes is a workaround to a parsing problem
[05Mar2006-19:03:18] Cratylus <ds> if you have an item like "khadgar's pipe of insight", the parser has trouble dealing with the apostrophe
[05Mar2006-19:03:42] Cratylus <ds> until i fix that parser bug, stripping apostrophes is a quick workaround
[05Mar2006-19:03:48] Cratylus <ds> i'm just the one guy, see
[05Mar2006-19:03:50] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> ahh
[05Mar2006-19:06:07] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> parser problem on driver side?
[05Mar2006-19:06:21] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> or mudlib?
[05Mar2006-19:06:27] Cratylus <ds> dunno yet. still on the todo list to examine
[05Mar2006-19:21:22] Arnolde@Xanth Mud <dead_souls> Sorry for the newbie question, but in long lines of description, why break it up into shorter lines with "+ ?
[05Mar2006-19:22:36] Cratylus <ds> tradition
[05Mar2006-19:23:00] Cratylus <ds> it's not needed, and in some exotic situations, even screws things up
[05Mar2006-19:23:26] Cratylus <ds> now, i'm talking about the +, not about breaking lines into shorter lines
[05Mar2006-19:23:54] Cratylus <ds> shorter lines are good for reasons of readability and to make sure there are no buffer problems with lines beeing too long
[05Mar2006-19:25:03] Arnolde@Xanth Mud <dead_souls> Got it, thanks
[05Mar2006-19:33:31] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Should the shutdown command crash when you first set it up?
[05Mar2006-19:33:55] Cratylus <ds> hmmm well no "crashing" isn't intended behavior
[05Mar2006-19:34:03] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> haha
[05Mar2006-19:34:05] Cratylus <ds> can you describe in more detail what happened?
[05Mar2006-19:34:05] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ya, I kinda thought so
[05Mar2006-19:34:42] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Sure, I changed the name of the game via admintool, and tried to reboot the mud via the tool, and it errored out halfway thru
[05Mar2006-19:34:58] Cratylus <ds> can you email me the error and crash messages?
[05Mar2006-19:35:08] Cratylus <ds> cratylus@comcast.net
[05Mar2006-19:36:20] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Sure, lemme see if it still does it
[05Mar2006-19:38:15] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Apparently it works now
[05Mar2006-19:38:29] Cratylus <ds> if you can email me the original messages that would be great
[05Mar2006-19:39:33] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I think I lost them in my back buffer, sorry
[05Mar2006-19:39:37] Cratylus <ds> k
[05Mar2006-19:40:25] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> My bad, I'm lying
[05Mar2006-19:40:35] Cratylus <ds> how so?
[05Mar2006-19:40:43] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I didn't lose it
[05Mar2006-19:41:02] Cratylus <ds> good
[05Mar2006-19:41:02] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Thought I had tried in telnet and lost it but I was wrong
[05Mar2006-19:41:36] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> There ya go
[05Mar2006-19:43:30] Cratylus <ds> ok, thx. that isn't really a crash
[05Mar2006-19:44:11] Cratylus <ds> what you're looking at is a successful shutdown where the system tries to forcibly log off everyone but errors on one or more
[05Mar2006-19:44:17] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Sorry, didn't know the correct term
[05Mar2006-19:44:19] Cratylus <ds> i'll look into why
[05Mar2006-19:44:33] Cratylus <ds> thanks for the error report
[05Mar2006-19:45:05] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Sorry, I'm a putz today
[05Mar2006-19:45:53] Cratylus <ds> yknow, i think that's enough "i suck" for today
[05Mar2006-19:46:11] Cratylus <ds> i appreciate the error report, and it really is ok to be a noob for a while
[05Mar2006-21:33:52] Cratylus <ds> hiya brodbane
[05Mar2006-21:34:02] Cratylus <ds> use this channel for questions n stuff
[05Mar2006-21:34:12] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> heya
[05Mar2006-21:34:22] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> Sorry, reorienting myself with the lib
[05Mar2006-21:35:19] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[05Mar2006-21:35:49] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> Whats the tell syntax?
[05Mar2006-21:35:55] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> tell <person> msg?
[05Mar2006-21:36:19] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> ah yes, domain helps
[05Mar2006-21:36:35] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> Brodbane = Ken Thompson. Thanks for the emailo
[05Mar2006-21:36:39] Cratylus <ds> no prob
[05Mar2006-21:36:51] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I'm not the founder of C++ though, thats a different Ken Thompson
[05Mar2006-21:36:53] Cratylus <ds> hope ds suits you
[05Mar2006-21:36:55] Cratylus <ds> heh
[05Mar2006-21:36:57] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> Although, I know him
[05Mar2006-21:37:22] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> The last mud I developed on was a nightmare release.  I stopped in 2002
[05Mar2006-21:37:52] Cratylus <ds> i've been trying to get descartes to donate the nightmare code to me
[05Mar2006-21:38:18] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> What is your history in all of this?
[05Mar2006-21:38:46] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I read the faq!
[05Mar2006-21:39:00] Cratylus <ds> nothing spectacular. just a dude who wanted to revive the code
[05Mar2006-21:39:16] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I'm happy to see it operational again
[05Mar2006-21:39:36] Cratylus <ds> it was rather trickier and more time consuming than i'd anticipated
[05Mar2006-21:39:42] Cratylus <ds> but fun to do
[05Mar2006-21:40:04] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> What was impressive was the single batch file to launch
[05Mar2006-21:40:12] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> Win32 was never a "smooth" ride
[05Mar2006-21:40:39] Cratylus <ds> getting it to work on windows was....less than easy
[05Mar2006-21:41:09] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I plan on using Win32, because of my utter lack of linux knowledge
[05Mar2006-21:42:03] Cratylus <ds> yeah, i figured that was a big obstacle to a lot of people
[05Mar2006-21:42:23] Cratylus <ds> and these days, win32 boxes are decent servers
[05Mar2006-21:42:25] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I've had mandrake/fedora up and running, but its difficult for me to troubleshoot
[05Mar2006-21:42:53] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I plan on launching a dedicated server tomorrow.  Our original mud was called "Eve" and it may be revived
[05Mar2006-21:43:03] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[05Mar2006-21:44:00] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> You noted a lack of database support
[05Mar2006-21:44:04] Cratylus <ds> yep
[05Mar2006-21:44:12] Cratylus <ds> i just dunno nothin about em
[05Mar2006-21:44:22] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> There will be some development done on a mysql backend.  All of that work will be public domain
[05Mar2006-21:44:38] Cratylus <ds> sweet
[05Mar2006-21:45:12] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> It will be interesting coding in structured C
[05Mar2006-21:45:16] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> It has its benefits though
[05Mar2006-21:47:08] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I actually run a diku mud and added database support to that
[05Mar2006-21:48:13] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> mysql/postgres?
[05Mar2006-21:48:25] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> MySQL
[05Mar2006-21:49:27] Brodbane@Dead_Souls_brodbane <dead_souls> I dont know enough about Diku to understand if its mutually beneficial
[05Mar2006-21:49:55] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> there are a few parts that it's useful for
[05Mar2006-22:34:59] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Much better
[06Mar2006-09:33:34] Tannis@Crimson Blood <dead_souls> po zi
[06Mar2006-09:34:08] Cratylus <ds> hello
[06Mar2006-09:34:28] Tannis@Crimson Blood <dead_souls> greetings, I was testing channel :)
[06Mar2006-09:34:56] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[06Mar2006-11:34:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Good morning
[06Mar2006-11:35:40] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Hi Brodbane.
[06Mar2006-16:04:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Man i love this lib!
[06Mar2006-21:18:49] Cratylus <ds> :) glad ya like it
[06Mar2006-21:19:19] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> he said that a looong time ago :p
[06Mar2006-21:29:20] Cratylus <ds> i catch up as i can
[06Mar2006-22:44:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> This lib has made my month
[06Mar2006-22:44:51] Jota@Eve <dead_souls> Test
[06Mar2006-22:44:51] Cratylus <ds> cool
[06Mar2006-22:45:21] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus, I did notice some issues though.  Minor
[06Mar2006-22:45:31] Cratylus <ds> go on
[06Mar2006-22:45:35] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> If you die by flee/tick bite, the pronouns are off
[06Mar2006-22:45:51] Cratylus <ds> agh yes, fixing the felas and lice are on the todo list
[06Mar2006-22:45:58] Cratylus <ds> fleas
[06Mar2006-22:46:06] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> And the fleas are not curable
[06Mar2006-22:46:24] Cratylus <ds> that's more of a screwup in coding an exaple than in the germ system
[06Mar2006-22:46:32] Cratylus <ds> but you're right, it needs fixing
[06Mar2006-22:46:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> The box of tricks in each wizards room was a nice touch.  It entertained me for about an hour
[06Mar2006-22:47:16] Cratylus <ds> what do you think of the manual and handbook?
[06Mar2006-22:47:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I haven't read the players manual.  I did read the wizard manual and did find a lot of useful things there
[06Mar2006-22:47:58] Cratylus <ds> k
[06Mar2006-22:48:20] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Did the use of "my" come standard with this lib?
[06Mar2006-22:48:46] Cratylus <ds> if you mean using it to specify objects to the parser, it's a mudos thing, not a lib thing
[06Mar2006-22:49:10] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> My old mud must of been an older mudos, because I was unable to use it previously
[06Mar2006-22:49:33] Cratylus <ds> yeah, mudos really did fix a lot of stuff since the old days
[06Mar2006-22:49:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Oh, I did find another bug.  It has to do with containers
[06Mar2006-22:49:43] Cratylus <ds> too bad it's no longer being maintained
[06Mar2006-22:50:01] Cratylus <ds> container recursiveness is fuxt, if that's what you mean
[06Mar2006-22:50:15] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> something else
[06Mar2006-22:50:29] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> if you put your staff in your robe, then relog, you will be holding a new staff
[06Mar2006-22:50:39] Cratylus <ds> heh
[06Mar2006-22:50:43] Cratylus <ds> weird
[06Mar2006-22:50:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> query_auto_load() a little funny
[06Mar2006-22:50:53] Cratylus <ds> i'll look into that. thank you
[06Mar2006-22:51:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I'll do some formal bug reports, i've been mostly playing
[06Mar2006-22:51:25] Cratylus <ds> eh, formalize it if you like, but i do ok with informal messages too
[06Mar2006-22:51:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Jota was in a lecture when I removed his right hand.  I believe he may of drawn some attention to himself
[06Mar2006-22:53:02] Cratylus <ds> the heal comand automatically fixes both health points and amputated limbs
[06Mar2006-22:53:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Yeah, I repaired him with the tricorder
[06Mar2006-22:55:20] Cratylus <ds> i'm rather drunk, so please excuse me if i'm missing something obvious, but i'm not spotting query_auto_load() as a sefun or efun
[06Mar2006-23:14:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Whoa, that was an outage
[06Mar2006-23:15:08] Cratylus <ds> ?
[06Mar2006-23:15:14] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Lost connection for a while
[07Mar2006-10:28:11] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> hello?
[07Mar2006-10:30:24] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> is anyone there that can help me with a coding question?
[07Mar2006-10:31:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> sure
[07Mar2006-10:31:28] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Thanks Brodbane
[07Mar2006-10:31:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> No problem, hopefully I can help
[07Mar2006-10:31:46] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I'm trying to create a working stargate and have not coded much before.
[07Mar2006-10:31:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Just to portal you to another place in the mud?
[07Mar2006-10:32:14] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> correct.  only in my own mud, just different domain.
[07Mar2006-10:32:26] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> like another world in my mud
[07Mar2006-10:32:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ok, thats just basically an exit
[07Mar2006-10:32:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> If you want it to be an item, like a couch that magically does that, it would be a function of the object
[07Mar2006-10:33:41] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Can it be something that I set?  I want to 'dial earth' for instance, then set the exit to a certain location.
[07Mar2006-10:33:59] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> after going through, I want to deactivate the item until it is dialed again.
[07Mar2006-10:34:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yes, thats easy enough.  Let me code an example for you
[07Mar2006-10:34:19] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> that would be cool.
[07Mar2006-10:34:29] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I can show you what I have so far if you want?
[07Mar2006-10:35:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> sure, would you like me to pop over?
[07Mar2006-10:35:25] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> you can do that?
[07Mar2006-10:35:44] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> yes if you can
[07Mar2006-10:35:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> IP address/port?
[07Mar2006-10:36:24] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> on a localhost ip 127.0.0.1 port 6666
[07Mar2006-10:36:26] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> does that help?
[07Mar2006-10:36:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ah, that wont allow me to enter your mud
[07Mar2006-10:36:46] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> how do I find my ip?
[07Mar2006-10:36:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> it would have to be a public IP.  We can work around that though
[07Mar2006-10:37:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> email kenthompson1@gmail.com your snippet
[07Mar2006-10:37:12] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> okay.
[07Mar2006-10:37:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I'm going to set up a website with examples that will compile with the dead souls lib at some point in the futuer
[07Mar2006-10:37:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> future
[07Mar2006-10:38:55] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> emailed.  that would be cool.  I also want to learn to compile my own mud, but I keep getting errors.
[07Mar2006-10:39:21] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yeah, thats not very easy
[07Mar2006-10:40:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Your snippet is pretty complete
[07Mar2006-10:40:45] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I got the second half from Cratylus and want to adjust it to allow to "dial to " a word.
[07Mar2006-10:40:57] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> like earth, or Chulak, etc...
[07Mar2006-10:41:05] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> but only certain places.
[07Mar2006-10:41:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok, so it would dial a word, then the word would line up with a place
[07Mar2006-10:41:25] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> correct.
[07Mar2006-10:41:39] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> like that now, except looks for an integer.
[07Mar2006-10:42:11] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I also only want the gate 'open' for a certain amount of time and then deactivate.
[07Mar2006-10:42:34] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok, you have the framework to do it fairly easily
[07Mar2006-10:42:50] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I know there is a way to do a preExit query, can I do a postExit?
[07Mar2006-10:43:12] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I can't take all the credit.  Cratylus helped a lot with it.
[07Mar2006-10:43:50] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> what I sent over to you is actually a room code.  I want to actually turn it in to an object that I can drop anywhere in my mud.
[07Mar2006-10:44:14] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ahh, thats not an issue.  You just cant use "exits/enters"
[07Mar2006-10:44:28] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You have to define a verb for entering the portal
[07Mar2006-10:44:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Let me whip up a basic portal that would do what you expect
[07Mar2006-10:45:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> it will be a couple, few work issues here need addressing
[07Mar2006-10:45:16] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> thought so.  So I define a verb for each 'address'...
[07Mar2006-10:45:22] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> that's okay.  I appreciate the help.
[07Mar2006-10:45:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You really only need "dial" and "enter"
[07Mar2006-10:45:59] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> and some pretty descriptions of what the portal is doing
[07Mar2006-10:46:39] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Ah...  I've already set an enter if the gate is inactive so when someone enters the gate, it says they need to dial an address first.
[07Mar2006-10:46:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> "You place your hand on the portals dial and slowly navigate to what appears to be an 'A''
[07Mar2006-10:47:37] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> that could work!!
[07Mar2006-10:47:49] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'll make it an object you drop
[07Mar2006-10:48:03] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> You would be a life-saver!!!
[07Mar2006-10:48:05] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD lurves writing portal code... gateways, pocket dimension spells, etc.
[07Mar2006-10:48:54] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> cool.  Spells are great, they just won't work with my technological world.
[07Mar2006-10:49:04] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh true
[07Mar2006-10:49:18] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I should email this to you when we get done.
[07Mar2006-10:50:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I really enjoy this community that Cratylus setup
[07Mar2006-10:50:34] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I do to.
[07Mar2006-10:50:58] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> The quick creation system is awesome and easy to do for basic rooms, etc...
[07Mar2006-10:51:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Its breathed new life into a very neglected system
[07Mar2006-10:51:52] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> who knows what the portal does in the Arch room?  It keeps taking me to the wiz room.
[07Mar2006-10:52:06] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> go to the arch room and do a 'cat here'
[07Mar2006-10:52:15] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I've seen some code for another mud and it is definately not as simple as this mud.
[07Mar2006-10:54:03] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> it just says the muds online and stuff.
[07Mar2006-10:54:13] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> its a long file, do a "tail here"
[07Mar2006-10:55:46] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> it's set to go to the wix_hall.  I thought, based on the screen, that it would allow travel to the muds on the screen.
[07Mar2006-10:56:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> nah, its just a way of seeing who uses this lib
[07Mar2006-10:56:26] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> ahh.  It is cool though.  There are a lot of muds.
[07Mar2006-10:56:34] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> what object does that?
[07Mar2006-10:56:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> 'arch'
[07Mar2006-10:56:42] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> lets you know who uses the lib?
[07Mar2006-10:56:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> read screen
[07Mar2006-10:57:02] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> It's cool.  In the Arch Room.
[07Mar2006-10:57:26] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> what's the filename of the arch itself?
[07Mar2006-10:57:34] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I wish the client room allowed other muds to be connected to.
[07Mar2006-10:57:42] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> arch.c
[07Mar2006-10:57:50] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> /secure/room/arch.c
[07Mar2006-10:58:18] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ahh
[07Mar2006-10:58:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> /secure/room/arch.c
[07Mar2006-10:58:46] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> was just curious to see if it used a custom connection or just intermud.
[07Mar2006-10:59:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> These channels are Cratylus's own design
[07Mar2006-10:59:39] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Speaking of channels, I saw a list of channels that can be added to the mud.  Does anyone know what the value part means?
[07Mar2006-10:59:53] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Cratylus is a GOD!
[07Mar2006-11:00:07] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> He is one of a kind
[07Mar2006-11:00:17] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> or how to add them?
[07Mar2006-11:00:45] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD wonders if he'll receive such high praise when he releases his lib... you sure you're not him in disguise and just advertising? ;-)
[07Mar2006-11:00:53] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Intermud, or more of DS channels?
[07Mar2006-11:01:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I'm not him.  I'm just a guy who shares his passion
[07Mar2006-11:01:33] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> not him.  He's idle I think.  I was under the impression that it was Intermud.
[07Mar2006-11:01:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> This is not intermud
[07Mar2006-11:01:52] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> oh.
[07Mar2006-11:02:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I could be wrong
[07Mar2006-11:02:10] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sorry.. I'm a newbie.
[07Mar2006-11:02:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Netstat is reporting198.144.203.194:9000
[07Mar2006-11:02:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> we can ask him
[07Mar2006-11:02:44] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> what is Netstat?
[07Mar2006-11:02:46] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> its intermud
[07Mar2006-11:03:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> netstat is your way of seeing what is open socket wise
[07Mar2006-11:03:08] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> Intermud3 to be exact
[07Mar2006-11:03:14] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thanks Kriton
[07Mar2006-11:03:26] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> yeah. thanks.
[07Mar2006-11:03:46] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> although it could be that this channel is being routed by some gateway
[07Mar2006-11:03:58] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it appears as I3 to me anyway ;-)
[07Mar2006-11:04:16] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> :)
[07Mar2006-11:04:20] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I'm not on a DS mudlib
[07Mar2006-11:04:28] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD just subscribes to the channel.
[07Mar2006-11:04:38] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> How do you subscribe?
[07Mar2006-11:04:38] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> although I do have a copy of the lib itself.
[07Mar2006-11:05:11] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> well, it depends on the lib... let me look at the ds lib and see if I can figure it out.
[07Mar2006-11:05:35] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I'm pretty sure in the FAQ it says he is using the intermud repeater
[07Mar2006-11:05:39] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I have a channel that tells me what channels I'm not subscribed to... then i add mappings in my intermud daemon.
[07Mar2006-11:06:25] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> cool.
[07Mar2006-11:06:27] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> How many people do you guys have on your muds?
[07Mar2006-11:08:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Our current creator number is 4, two being the lib guys
[07Mar2006-11:08:28] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> ah.
[07Mar2006-11:08:38] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Just me here and my test character :(
[07Mar2006-11:10:22] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> hist
[07Mar2006-11:10:26] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sorry.
[07Mar2006-11:10:38] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> a little backwords.
[07Mar2006-11:11:23] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> my mud peaked back in the mid 90's with 40-60 players online
[07Mar2006-11:11:41] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> WOW.  What kind of theme do you have?
[07Mar2006-11:11:47] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I shut it down with the intent of re-opening but I've been stuck in redesign mode ever since.
[07Mar2006-11:12:09] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> Its based entirely on the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.
[07Mar2006-11:12:19] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Good series.
[07Mar2006-11:12:21] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> (along with a bazillion other muds)
[07Mar2006-11:12:23] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh
[07Mar2006-11:12:53] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Two Towers mud is a good Lord of the Rings mud, from what my girlfriend says.
[07Mar2006-11:13:05] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I tried to come up with some unique features tho.  professions and player government (players build cities on a virtual landscape, form kingdoms, go to war with NPC armies, etc)
[07Mar2006-11:13:21] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> that would be cool.
[07Mar2006-11:14:05] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah, its fun ... I just need to finish the current version and stop tweaking with it.
[07Mar2006-11:14:32] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> :)
[07Mar2006-11:14:38] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> hehe
[07Mar2006-11:15:00] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> lpc is such a fun medium to work with, too.
[07Mar2006-11:15:26] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> thats why I favor it so much over C/Diku... you can create far more complex code in less time (imo)
[07Mar2006-11:15:42] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> yes it is.  The only problem I face when trying to learn to code with this lib is when there is an error, it doesn't explain what the error is.
[07Mar2006-11:16:22] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> as a newbie, I get errors a lot :)
[07Mar2006-11:16:27] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> well, takes a little time to interpret... but usually
[07Mar2006-11:16:39] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> you'll be able to discern something from it.
[07Mar2006-11:16:49] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> are these runtime errors or compile errors?
[07Mar2006-11:17:41] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD should write a fuzzy logic lpc error interpreter.
[07Mar2006-11:17:51] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> compile i think.
[07Mar2006-11:18:51] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> syntax errors and whatnot.
[07Mar2006-11:18:55] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> It references lines that are higher than the line of code that I am working on.
[07Mar2006-11:19:17] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> thats usually from a runaway " or something
[07Mar2006-11:19:29] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> i.e. you didn't close a string out
[07Mar2006-11:19:40] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Error in loading object '/domains/town/room/town_stargate'
[07Mar2006-11:19:40] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Object: /secure/cmds/creators/update at line 148

[07Mar2006-11:19:58] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> oh.  okay.
[07Mar2006-11:20:20] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> does ds have a command to go through the stack frame by frame?
[07Mar2006-11:20:36] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> not sure.
[07Mar2006-11:21:02] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> so you might have been working on town_stargate.c on line 12 and had "marry had a little lamb
[07Mar2006-11:21:22] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> :)
[07Mar2006-11:21:26] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> and then line 148 has something like SetLong("bob was here")
[07Mar2006-11:22:28] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> mudos would see there was no closing " on line 12 and skip all the way down to 148 (treating lines 12-148 as one big string) before it got confused.
[07Mar2006-11:22:42] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> just an example tho
[07Mar2006-11:22:57] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> makes sense, I think.
[07Mar2006-11:22:59] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> of why the line numbers may seem odd
[07Mar2006-11:23:33] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Just threw me for a loop when I only have 97 lines in my code.
[07Mar2006-11:23:57] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD grins
[07Mar2006-11:24:05] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> now *that* is odd
[07Mar2006-11:24:39] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I think it is because it is calling other files when it runs, that it conflicts with the lib code.
[07Mar2006-11:24:41] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> you're using some sort of wizard tho/creator assistant?
[07Mar2006-11:25:15] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Just using Ultra Edit Studio to code a room, then try and update or reload the file in the mud.
[07Mar2006-11:25:43] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> oh... after looking at the error dump it looks like it might be referring to the update command itself
[07Mar2006-11:25:57] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> hard to read the stack trace over the channel
[07Mar2006-11:26:08] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> ah..  That is true.
[07Mar2006-11:27:06] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I like the wizard creator objects in this lib.  Like the room maker.  It is menu driven and makes things much easier.
[07Mar2006-11:28:04] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD has written many, many type systems hehe
[07Mar2006-11:28:16] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> such things rather
[07Mar2006-11:28:38] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD has even found his maker systems on other muds :p
[07Mar2006-11:29:10] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> :)  If it works and you don't get a profit, I don't see the problem.
[07Mar2006-11:29:31] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I wish more muds were compatible code-wise.
[07Mar2006-11:29:39] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh
[07Mar2006-11:29:53] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> no problem, I just like to know when people take the code ;-)
[07Mar2006-11:30:07] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I'm sure they could be modified for my mud, I just don't know how.
[07Mar2006-11:30:15] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD nods
[07Mar2006-11:30:27] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> yeah.  code is code, eventually they would figure it out on their own.
[07Mar2006-11:30:37] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> it's just polite though.
[07Mar2006-11:30:45] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah, I wrote one for windows using MFC.  it had a 'definitions' file to create custom output for any mudlib.
[07Mar2006-11:30:59] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> really?
[07Mar2006-11:31:05] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD nods
[07Mar2006-11:31:31] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> nod
[07Mar2006-11:31:41] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I don't know if it would still run very well... I might have to re-create it / bring it up to the .net era
[07Mar2006-11:32:02] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it was my first real win32 app
[07Mar2006-11:32:08] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> for the mud being so old, it still is fun.
[07Mar2006-11:32:16] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD nods
[07Mar2006-11:32:22] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> I don't know how to program outside of the mud.
[07Mar2006-11:32:32] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> can't even compile.
[07Mar2006-11:32:36] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah, I play world of warcraft, but MMORPGs still don't have the depth you can get on a mud.
[07Mar2006-11:33:18] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> heard world of warcraft was a fun game.  A co-worker plays it and raves about it.
[07Mar2006-11:34:14] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah the thing that annoys me about it is that those game worlds are pretty static.
[07Mar2006-11:34:32] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> i.e. no matter how powerful you get, you cannot really change the world
[07Mar2006-11:34:44] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> which is where my player government system comes in
[07Mar2006-11:35:08] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> when a player lays the foundation for a city hall, he/she changes the landscape.
[07Mar2006-11:35:12] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> True.  How do you set up a government, or guild.  I noticed a file that is called guild in this lib, just not sure how to use it.
[07Mar2006-11:35:43] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> they can do that without causing errors?  Or do you have a creation system?
[07Mar2006-11:35:47] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> guilds on most libs are an object loaded onto the player
[07Mar2006-11:36:09] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah its whats called a virtual system
[07Mar2006-11:36:29] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> i write a framework of objects like buildings, npc servants, etc
[07Mar2006-11:36:59] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> the player says 'i want to build a house'.  it clones the house and takes the descriptions from the player and stores them in a mysql database.
[07Mar2006-11:37:11] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> that's cool
[07Mar2006-11:37:27] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> the location and descriptions are stored in the database and when the mud reboots and that location is reloaded, the house appears again in the room.
[07Mar2006-11:37:49] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> so the player doesn't really code anything per se
[07Mar2006-11:37:49] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> what lib do you use?
[07Mar2006-11:37:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> they just modify a template.
[07Mar2006-11:38:09] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> brodbane are you still here?
[07Mar2006-11:38:09] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> its my own lib... way back in '93 it was Nightmare 3.2
[07Mar2006-11:38:21] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Ah.  Isn't Dead Souls based on that?
[07Mar2006-11:38:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> sorry, i'm here
[07Mar2006-11:38:40] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> well, Nightmare 3.2 led to Nightmare IV which led to Dead Souls.
[07Mar2006-11:38:44] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Know you're working.  Just missed you.
[07Mar2006-11:38:54] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> thought you left.
[07Mar2006-11:38:56] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> :) Darn work! So ditracting
[07Mar2006-11:39:04] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> :(
[07Mar2006-11:39:06] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> distracting
[07Mar2006-11:39:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> finger brodbane@eve
[07Mar2006-11:39:32] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> or maybe Nightmare IV->Foundation->Dead Souls
[07Mar2006-11:39:32] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> okay.
[07Mar2006-11:40:38] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> LP Mud->TMI->TMI II->Nightmare 2/3->Nightmare IV->Foundation I/II->Dead Souls?
[07Mar2006-11:40:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> My old mud was foundation II
[07Mar2006-11:41:20] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> this is my first mud.
[07Mar2006-11:41:49] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> does my finger daemon work btw? :p
[07Mar2006-11:42:03] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sorry.  yes it did.
[07Mar2006-11:42:05] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD doesn't know how well his mud works.
[07Mar2006-11:42:13] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD snickers
[07Mar2006-11:42:33] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> no plan?
[07Mar2006-11:42:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> its not included in the intermud finger return... I could modify it pretty quick to include it
[07Mar2006-11:43:37] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> oh. it said 'this is an empty plan file'
[07Mar2006-11:44:45] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> maybe I'm missing something from the I3 spec
[07Mar2006-11:46:24] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> did it show you my lack of spouse, best kill, etc?
[07Mar2006-11:47:04] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sing,e best kill, arch foe.
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sorry, I was looking at brodbane when I saw the empty plan.
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> my mistake.
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> your's doesn't have one.
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ?
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ahh
[07Mar2006-11:50:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I modified my daemon to return my .project and .plan
[07Mar2006-11:50:57] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Cool plan.
[07Mar2006-11:50:57] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> hehehe
[07Mar2006-11:56:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> How long before your baby is born?
[07Mar2006-11:57:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> We just had ours
[07Mar2006-12:01:30] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> congratulations ;-)
[07Mar2006-12:01:39] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ours is due in late june
[07Mar2006-12:01:45] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ~25th
[07Mar2006-12:03:19] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> first one?
[07Mar2006-12:04:11] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah :)
[07Mar2006-12:04:24] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it took a while but yeah
[07Mar2006-12:04:30] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> good timing though
[07Mar2006-12:04:50] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> we just bought our first house and a week later we found out we were pregnant
[07Mar2006-12:05:12] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hhahahha, thats exactly what happened to us
[07Mar2006-12:05:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> exactly. I kid you not
[07Mar2006-12:05:26] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> hehe cool ;-)
[07Mar2006-12:25:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> went ld
[07Mar2006-12:29:49] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> sorry guys.  Need to go to work.  I'll have to talk to you later.  Any help you can give my on the Stargate Brodbane would be appreciated.  If you want to email me some suggestions or tips, just reply to the email.
[07Mar2006-12:30:01] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'll do that
[07Mar2006-12:30:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> see you later:)
[07Mar2006-14:43:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Anyone alive? Testing..
[07Mar2006-14:43:52] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> we're all still here... you didn't kill us.
[07Mar2006-14:44:06] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> last
[07Mar2006-14:44:10] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> who
[07Mar2006-14:44:10] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Just showing Ptah, Eve's most recent addition the DS channel
[07Mar2006-14:44:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ptah is a dev from my old mud
[07Mar2006-15:40:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> anyone out there?
[07Mar2006-15:40:45] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yes
[07Mar2006-15:40:49] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> finally
[07Mar2006-15:40:59] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> thought i would never find someone
[07Mar2006-15:41:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hehe
[07Mar2006-15:41:29] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> you didnt find anyone, we dont exist
[07Mar2006-15:41:41] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> oh darn, more automated servers?
[07Mar2006-15:41:49] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus made us.  Welcome Oriam $N
[07Mar2006-15:42:07] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> wow, you ALMOST sound like humans :)
[07Mar2006-15:42:11] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ahaha
[07Mar2006-15:42:39] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so, are  you all very familiar with this codebase?
[07Mar2006-15:42:59] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ptah and I are LPC people
[07Mar2006-15:43:30] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i know lpc pretty well. could yall tell me how to add/remove emotes?
[07Mar2006-15:43:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> just delete them from the verb directory
[07Mar2006-15:44:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> well, you could override the command in the player object to do nothing, remove the emote.c file...
[07Mar2006-15:45:44] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> wheres the emote.c file located?
[07Mar2006-15:46:12] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> try /cmds/players/emote.c
[07Mar2006-15:46:41] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ahh okay, i was trying to find it in verbs
[07Mar2006-15:46:51] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> which emote
[07Mar2006-15:46:57] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> useful command
[07Mar2006-15:46:59] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> in general
[07Mar2006-15:47:11] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> no, the command, type which emote
[07Mar2006-15:47:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ah okay
[07Mar2006-15:48:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so, how do i add emotes here
[07Mar2006-15:49:11] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> They dont currently work?
[07Mar2006-15:49:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i want to change the nod emote, but im not quite sure how
[07Mar2006-15:49:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> do a which nod
[07Mar2006-15:49:48] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> not a .c command
[07Mar2006-15:49:52] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> just a sec
[07Mar2006-15:49:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> darn
[07Mar2006-15:49:54] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> says nod: not found
[07Mar2006-15:50:56] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> (bad humour warning)  "Nod found"?
[07Mar2006-15:51:04] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ....
[07Mar2006-15:51:12] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I am thinking it's part of the living object, checking
[07Mar2006-15:51:32] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Thats kind of funny
[07Mar2006-15:51:42] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> no it's nod
[07Mar2006-15:51:54] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so i type 'which nod'
[07Mar2006-15:53:15] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> no, its not a standard verb
[07Mar2006-15:53:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> That means?
[07Mar2006-15:53:45] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> verb = action
[07Mar2006-15:53:53] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so, how do i change it?
[07Mar2006-15:53:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> standard verb = who, look
[07Mar2006-15:54:05] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ahh okay
[07Mar2006-15:55:42] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> where would i find the file to edit nod
[07Mar2006-15:56:14] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> it's part of one of the objects that made your character
[07Mar2006-15:56:18] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> but not living.c
[07Mar2006-15:56:32] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> sorry, im a little confused here
[07Mar2006-15:56:46] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> which object are we talking about?
[07Mar2006-15:58:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> not sure, haven't found where nod is being called
[07Mar2006-15:58:36] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> oh okay, i thought you meant you had found it
[07Mar2006-16:01:07] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> There's a reference in lib/save/soul.o
[07Mar2006-16:01:17] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ill check it out
[07Mar2006-16:01:29] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> You can't edit, or shouldn't be able to edit .o files
[07Mar2006-16:03:00] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hrmm, indeed there is
[07Mar2006-16:03:54] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> But, that's a point of reference for going backwards
[07Mar2006-16:05:39] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> egh nvm
[07Mar2006-16:05:51] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> how would i add a completely new emote?
[07Mar2006-16:06:13] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> That's kinda the whole thing there.  If we knew one, we'd know the other
[07Mar2006-16:06:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> sorry got lost there
[07Mar2006-16:11:28] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> blargh
[07Mar2006-16:11:52] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> From all I can tell, it's only getting pushed into soul.o
[07Mar2006-16:12:09] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Mind you LP muds aren't my specialty so
[07Mar2006-16:12:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ill ask an admin on my normal mud
[07Mar2006-16:12:29] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> As an example, if you look at help feelings
[07Mar2006-16:12:53] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> look for the most obscure one you can find, such as shellshock, when you do a search through the lib, it only appears in soul.o
[07Mar2006-16:14:19] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Well, my guess now is that soul.o isn't an object file, so looks like you'll need to edit it from there
[07Mar2006-16:14:57] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Lemme try something real quick and I'll let you know
[07Mar2006-16:15:09] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i got a high wiz from my normal mud lookin into it
[07Mar2006-16:20:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> kay, hes on right now
[07Mar2006-16:20:55] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Alright
[07Mar2006-16:25:23] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hrmm, he says its something about feelings
[07Mar2006-16:46:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> okay, the command is addemote but it gives me an error
[07Mar2006-16:46:53] Ave@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> looks like you've got a good problem to start off your career with
[07Mar2006-16:47:03] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> you have to be of a certain level to use this command
[07Mar2006-16:47:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> im arch
[07Mar2006-16:47:15] Ave@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> it's an admin command
[07Mar2006-16:47:57] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i get everything entered right, but it gives me an error
[07Mar2006-16:48:09] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> has something to do with the parser
[07Mar2006-17:56:38] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis: Evolution <dead_souls> I just dl'd DS, waddya you guys think of it for development purposes?
[07Mar2006-17:58:18] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Seems pretty decent to me, although I'm more of a Diku person tryin to get away from that
[07Mar2006-17:58:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> you guys reading this? I broke somethin
[07Mar2006-17:59:05] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Yup
[07Mar2006-18:00:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thanks
[07Mar2006-18:00:43] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Yup
[07Mar2006-18:01:49] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis: Evolution <dead_souls> well I like LP's since you can do so much more with them, is the maillist pretty active?
[07Mar2006-18:02:12] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Taking off for a while.  Catch you all later
[07Mar2006-18:02:22] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> later Brodbane
[07Mar2006-20:40:51] Cratylus <ds> looks like i missed a chat party
[08Mar2006-07:31:45] Cratylus <ds> test
[08Mar2006-10:43:49] Cratylus <ds> w00t
[08Mar2006-10:46:31] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Hello Cratylus
[08Mar2006-10:47:58] Cratylus <ds> hiya
[08Mar2006-10:50:29] Cratylus <ds> looks like intermud is back up
[08Mar2006-10:50:43] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> why did it go down?
[08Mar2006-10:50:53] Cratylus <ds> beats me. i don't run the router
[08Mar2006-10:50:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> budget cuts
[08Mar2006-10:51:01] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> ah.
[08Mar2006-10:52:03] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Intermud was considered an entiltement program by the Bush administration and was cut
[08Mar2006-10:52:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I thought intermud was owned by the dubei company
[08Mar2006-10:52:39] Cratylus <ds> well, technically, they just didn't approve the funding increase for fiscal year 2006
[08Mar2006-10:53:36] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Ahhh, good humor, I love ot
[08Mar2006-10:53:38] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> it
[08Mar2006-10:55:30] Cratylus <ds> i'm the good humor man
[08Mar2006-10:58:25] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> can I get an Ice Cream Sandwich then?
[08Mar2006-10:58:39] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> clone icecream.c
[08Mar2006-10:59:21] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Explain, you are using words that I dont use in proper context when i try and use them
[08Mar2006-10:59:51] Cratylus <ds> eval return present("ice cream",this_player())->SetType("sandwich")
[08Mar2006-11:00:28] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I think you just set that payer to type 'sandwich'
[08Mar2006-11:00:34] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> player*
[08Mar2006-11:00:46] Cratylus <ds> my bad
[08Mar2006-11:00:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> nm, formatting is all off here, stupid windows telnet
[08Mar2006-11:01:04] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> daelas No problem, i had fun with it
[08Mar2006-11:01:12] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> woops, mistell
[08Mar2006-11:39:42] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> are the classes all virtual? I can't seem to find any .c file for the class other then the class daemon,
[08Mar2006-11:40:00] Cratylus <ds> /secure/cfg/classes
[08Mar2006-11:40:28] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> Ashon, are you actually in a Stargate mud?
[08Mar2006-11:40:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> right, those seem to just be the class definitions
[08Mar2006-11:41:18] Cratylus <ds> yes. if you want to create a new class, make a new file in that dir following the same format, then use admintool to add the class to the class daemon
[08Mar2006-11:41:34] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Daelas- I'm trying to create one, I'm on day two of learning DS
[08Mar2006-11:41:56] Cratylus <ds> ashon, any problems with the documentation?
[08Mar2006-11:42:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I have a problem with the docs.  They are iin english
[08Mar2006-11:42:33] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Freaking Southerners
[08Mar2006-11:42:35] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Cratylus, other then not having the documentation that I'm looking for, yes.
[08Mar2006-11:42:43] Cratylus <ds> actually they're in rigellian. by an astonishing coincidence, our two languages are exactly the same
[08Mar2006-11:42:59] Cratylus <ds> you mean the class thing? yeah, i'll add that to the faq
[08Mar2006-11:42:59] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> so long, thanks for the fish
[08Mar2006-11:43:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I speak Rigellian?
[08Mar2006-11:43:11] Daelas@Moraelinost <dead_souls> how do you learn the languages available?
[08Mar2006-11:43:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I told my wife i was cultured.
[08Mar2006-11:43:39] Cratylus <ds> well, learning is done with trainers, but a creator can just add the language to himself
[08Mar2006-11:43:59] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, so the classes are virtual, then I guess my question becomes, where is the code for skills?
[08Mar2006-11:44:29] Cratylus <ds> can you explain a little more what you're looking for?
[08Mar2006-11:46:06] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> well, I want to create new skills for the classes, but I can't find where the skills are defined.
[08Mar2006-11:46:38] Cratylus <ds> hmmm
[08Mar2006-11:47:18] Cratylus <ds> ya i need to explain a bit more clearly the skills system in the faq
[08Mar2006-11:47:56] Cratylus <ds> the deal is that a skill is useful only in the context of doing something the lib understands
[08Mar2006-11:48:26] Cratylus <ds> for example, the reason "blade attack" is useful is that /lib/combat.c (among others) uses it as a modifier
[08Mar2006-11:49:11] Cratylus <ds> what this means is that all the skills the lib understand are those currently listed in the files /secure/cfg/classes
[08Mar2006-11:49:51] Cratylus <ds> so that generally, if it isn't there, it isn't a skill the lib knows about
[08Mar2006-11:50:07] Cratylus <ds> however, putting one in there doesnt mean the lib can do anything with it, either
[08Mar2006-11:50:37] Cratylus <ds> for example, suppose you want to add a basketweaver class, and one of the skills is, well, weaving
[08Mar2006-11:51:27] Cratylus <ds> just because weaving is one of the skills in /secure/cfg/basketweaver doesnt mean it's in any way helpful to the player, if weaving isnt something that has a verb and lib objects that handle it
[08Mar2006-11:51:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Am i logging ds by default? This is some good stuff
[08Mar2006-11:51:54] Cratylus <ds> heh
[08Mar2006-11:52:02] Cratylus <ds> i think so. check /log/cha
[08Mar2006-11:52:04] Cratylus <ds> i think so. check /log/chan
[08Mar2006-11:52:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thanks, its there
[08Mar2006-11:52:26] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> sweet
[08Mar2006-11:52:42] Cratylus <ds> does that answer the question, ashon?
[08Mar2006-11:53:10] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay got it.  so weave.c will go in the verb folder, and then make a reference to it in the class cfg files.
[08Mar2006-11:53:18] Cratylus <ds> right on
[08Mar2006-11:53:46] Cratylus <ds> though usually what'll happen is the verb acts on an object that inherits, let's sat, /lib/basjet.c
[08Mar2006-11:54:06] Cratylus <ds> or /lib/loom.c, and that object is what determines the usefulness of the skill
[08Mar2006-11:54:24] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> so if I wanted to make unique racial abilities aka vampires that suck blood, they would need a verb and then a call from the race cfg file
[08Mar2006-11:54:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> right understand that part of it.
[08Mar2006-11:54:44] Cratylus <ds> i wouldn't use the word "call" that way, but it sounds like you've got the idea
[08Mar2006-11:55:17] Cratylus <ds> a good example of bloodsucking would be the steal verb
[08Mar2006-11:55:21] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> a reference if you will then.  The body object would 'call' the functionality.
[08Mar2006-11:55:45] Cratylus <ds> thieves have a skill for this, and their success is determined by their skill as measured by various /lib objects
[08Mar2006-11:56:49] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> right.
[08Mar2006-11:57:23] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> thanks Cratylus.
[08Mar2006-11:57:33] Cratylus <ds> no prob. thanks for pointing out the documentation gap
[08Mar2006-11:57:53] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> meh, no problem.
[08Mar2006-12:08:57] A shadow@Carnivore <dead_souls> hang on i just noticed you said /secure/cfg/races
[08Mar2006-12:09:41] Cratylus <ds> i didnt notice that
[08Mar2006-12:10:05] Cratylus <ds> the skills thing isnt something you should try to do in a race file
[08Mar2006-12:10:51] Cratylus <ds> this raises an interesting issue
[08Mar2006-12:12:12] Cratylus <ds> you just pointed out a feature gap
[08Mar2006-12:14:00] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> so, you can't have special racial verbs?
[08Mar2006-12:14:14] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I have special racial verbs but they are impolite
[08Mar2006-12:14:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> My dwarven sexiness was inherent...
[08Mar2006-12:14:55] Cratylus <ds> dang. this is what happens when you only code lib stuff. you forget obvious shit like that
[08Mar2006-12:15:15] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Craytlus, who died and cursed you with the maintenance?
[08Mar2006-12:15:19] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I'm a trouble maker what can I say?
[08Mar2006-12:15:23] Cratylus <ds> as of now there is no good racial skill system. however this issue's pretty much rocketed to number one on my todo list
[08Mar2006-12:15:39] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> w00t!
[08Mar2006-12:16:13] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> so question, would a dark elf be better at dancing and a surface elf be better at math skills?
[08Mar2006-12:16:23] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Ptah- didn't you read any of the documentation/history of DS?  Cratylus CHOSE to do it!
[08Mar2006-12:17:26] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> then that man needs a beer
[08Mar2006-12:18:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ptah, ED/BR has made us synical
[08Mar2006-12:18:48] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> nod, I am now an agnostic cynic
[08Mar2006-12:18:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus is that gem we never ran into
[08Mar2006-12:19:14] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> We got Nameless, Caliel and a few others to ruin our perception of lib developers
[08Mar2006-12:19:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Heh, ok, long story short, we had a couple of talented guys who were very arbitrary in their enhancements
[08Mar2006-12:25:28] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> lib dev is a bitch, and you've gotta really love the intense code hacking to do it.  these are people who go one to program things like *nix daemons.
[08Mar2006-12:26:33] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> nog, and have a total disregard for formatting code
[08Mar2006-12:31:38] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Heh, sorry, one of my pet peeves, I get down on my jr. programmers for formatting so bad
[08Mar2006-12:32:54] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I've noticed the formatting is horrible.  but I'm not complaining yet, I've got other work to do.
[08Mar2006-12:33:41] Cratylus <ds> for real? you guys dont like the ds formatting?
[08Mar2006-12:33:53] Cratylus <ds> are the lines too long?
[08Mar2006-12:34:41] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Well, I've been looking at some of the descartes code, and man, indentation, using function declarations inside of calls, call me a purist, but it's difficult to read at times
[08Mar2006-12:35:33] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I understand when LPC first came out it was partially a space issue with files, but I believe we are past that constraint nowdays
[08Mar2006-12:35:39] Cratylus <ds> interesting. if yuo don't mind, i'd love an example of what you mean. do you have a specific filename that illustrates this?
[08Mar2006-12:35:46] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> oh code formatting?  I've got some serious wrapping issues on my client then
[08Mar2006-12:35:52] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> interactive.c
[08Mar2006-12:37:38] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> omg, I just realized I've been on lpc since 1992
[08Mar2006-12:38:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> 1992? That was the 6th grade for me, congrats
[08Mar2006-12:38:20] Cratylus <ds> yeah that is kinda ugly
[08Mar2006-12:38:30] Cratylus <ds> i guess i've just gotten used to that
[08Mar2006-12:38:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> wow... I was already a few years out of the army in 92
[08Mar2006-12:39:01] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> thanks for making me feel old
[08Mar2006-12:39:21] Cratylus <ds> by the way, even if a file has descartes name on top, it's probably been modified by me in one way or another. i'm just too lazy to bother with headers
[08Mar2006-12:39:43] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I just assume you wrote everything.  Easier to pass blame that way
[08Mar2006-12:39:49] Cratylus <ds> :)
[08Mar2006-12:40:05] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Heh
[08Mar2006-12:40:31] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Forcing me to write a code formatter utility, I suppose that could be a nice mental exercise though
[08Mar2006-12:42:24] Cratylus <ds> the way i do the formatting is this: i write my sloppy ass code any which way i feel like, then right before a code release, i use a source script and lsed to auto-indent everything
[08Mar2006-12:42:26] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> gah that's the kind of crap they make you write in c 101 type classes.
[08Mar2006-12:42:50] Cratylus <ds> which is why i was a little surprised. i figured that the default formatting spat out by ed would look pretty normal
[08Mar2006-12:43:02] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> fear... ed
[08Mar2006-12:43:18] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> You're not still on a tty term are you Cratylus?
[08Mar2006-12:43:32] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> ed is your friend.  love it, want it, caress it.
[08Mar2006-12:43:44] Cratylus <ds> for coding i use vim or gvim as the mood strikes me
[08Mar2006-12:44:08] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Ok, here's fear for you, I first started on a 110 baud tty term that used paper, no screen
[08Mar2006-12:45:06] Cratylus <ds> that's before my time. when i started coding i was on the actual DEC vt100 terminals hooked up by serial to the campus vax
[08Mar2006-12:45:31] Cratylus <ds> maxed out at 9600bps
[08Mar2006-12:45:45] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I remember when 9600 came out I was like "OMG this is fast!!!"
[08Mar2006-12:46:25] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> poor apple //e, 4800 was too fast for the processor to get the info in before it lost characters
[08Mar2006-12:47:11] Cratylus <ds> though one time over xmas break i was reduced to using a c64 on a 300bps modem dialed into the campus server
[08Mar2006-12:47:21] Cratylus <ds> that was rough stuff
[08Mar2006-12:47:23] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ahahah, a commode!
[08Mar2006-12:48:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> whoa!  Watch it.  c64 pm 4800 to compuserve!  ahhh the days!
[08Mar2006-12:48:29] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> *pm = on a
[08Mar2006-12:48:34] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Apple guy here, still am, got a nice dual G5 now, oh and some pos 3gb wintel box
[08Mar2006-12:49:04] Cratylus <ds> i use a sun ultrasparc box
[08Mar2006-12:49:32] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Those are pretty sexy
[08Mar2006-12:49:52] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I almost bought a sparc/10 a long while back
[08Mar2006-12:50:02] Cratylus <ds> heh
[08Mar2006-12:50:08] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> now I just want a cray ymp for nostalgia
[08Mar2006-12:51:27] Cratylus <ds> i saw a sun enterprise 10000 on ebay for a little over $10k, 20 procs, loads of ram. they use the cray crossbar
[08Mar2006-12:51:37] Cratylus <ds> dunno about the electricity bill tho
[08Mar2006-12:52:09] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> heh, ymp is not as powerful as a laptop anymore and uses huge energy
[08Mar2006-12:52:19] Cratylus <ds> my little 4-wat/6gig ram box sucks up plenty enough juice
[08Mar2006-12:52:25] Cratylus <ds> 4-way
[08Mar2006-12:52:49] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> yeah, my dual g5 sucks the juice so bad I crisped a processor on a brownout
[08Mar2006-12:52:57] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> yay yay applecare
[08Mar2006-12:53:19] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> and of course a line conditioner
[08Mar2006-12:55:00] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I am from the land of Cray, I got to play with those bad boys in highschool and anything that compiled a program in .007843 seconds was the computer for me.
[08Mar2006-12:55:14] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh
[08Mar2006-12:55:26] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD had a Vax II! :P
[08Mar2006-12:55:38] Cratylus <ds> i never could stand vms
[08Mar2006-12:55:42] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it couldn't do anything in .007843 seconds
[08Mar2006-12:56:00] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I couldn't either, actually
[08Mar2006-12:56:10] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> heh, they were sexy machines for the day, now just an expensive alternative to a beowulf cluster
[08Mar2006-12:56:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> crays that is
[08Mar2006-12:56:34] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> the vax had a "unix board"
[08Mar2006-12:56:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> like the mac 6100 dual had a "intel board"
[08Mar2006-12:56:57] Cratylus <ds> yeah, but i didnt much like ultrix either
[08Mar2006-12:57:23] Cratylus <ds> got the job done, i guess
[08Mar2006-12:57:45] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I like BSD and Linux, Linux is probably the best thing to ever happen to the net
[08Mar2006-12:57:49] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD didn't mind ultix so much.  liked sunos more, but never managed to score any hardware.
[08Mar2006-12:58:35] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD runs all linux now... I have a copy of solaris for x86 but haven't used it for anything.
[08Mar2006-12:59:01] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> but then again, I was impressed with Minix.
[08Mar2006-13:03:49] Cratylus <ds> dont bother with solaris x86 unless you have a specific reason to use it
[08Mar2006-13:03:59] Cratylus <ds> but solaris for sparc is Teh Shit
[08Mar2006-13:20:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Did you guys notice a mud named 'Jedi Nights'?
[08Mar2006-13:20:54] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thds Wonder if they meant 'Knights'
[08Mar2006-13:21:02] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I think Darth mud hunted it down and killed the last of it
[08Mar2006-13:22:59] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> maybe its where Jedi's go to part
[08Mar2006-13:23:01] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> part->party
[08Mar2006-13:23:11] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> kind of like Boogie Nights, but with Jedi
[08Mar2006-13:23:25] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> reserves all his lightsaber comments now in respect to that
[08Mar2006-13:24:11] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh
[08Mar2006-13:37:33] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> finger ptah
[08Mar2006-13:37:37] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> hrm
[08Mar2006-13:37:39] Cratylus <ds> no thx
[08Mar2006-13:38:01] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Brokeback Mux
[08Mar2006-13:38:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> What a great mud idea. Brokeback
[08Mar2006-13:39:06] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Yeah it would be the SHIT!, er um...
[08Mar2006-13:39:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> We would so win an oscar
[08Mar2006-13:40:12] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I dont believe I could relate well enough to the subject matter to make it work
[08Mar2006-13:44:27] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> heh
[08Mar2006-13:45:28] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> $N wears his +5 buttless chaps.  (eww)
[08Mar2006-13:45:50] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> $N lets this thing take ahold of him
[08Mar2006-13:46:28] Cratylus <ds> wtf
[08Mar2006-13:46:38] Cratylus <ds> are chan emotes fuxt?
[08Mar2006-13:46:46] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> no
[08Mar2006-13:47:02] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ahahah, no no no no
[08Mar2006-13:47:02] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD didn't want to actually put HIS name in that example
[08Mar2006-13:47:06] <ds> Cratylus tests something.
[08Mar2006-13:47:26] Cratylus <ds> whew ok
[08Mar2006-13:47:50] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> $N wonders wtf Cratylus is talking about
[08Mar2006-13:48:00] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> you could hardcode the gender tho... that would make it easy... would you like to be [M]ale or m[A]le
[08Mar2006-13:48:29] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Oh my
[08Mar2006-13:48:39] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> yeah probably better to stop now
[08Mar2006-13:49:05] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Hey, I am as homo erotic as the next guy, but still
[08Mar2006-13:49:53] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> ?
[08Mar2006-13:53:08] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> that's called humor
[08Mar2006-14:11:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Maybe I dont want to be logging DS...
[08Mar2006-14:53:59] Cratylus <ds> hi alswyn. use this channel for questions n stuff
[08Mar2006-14:56:41] Aldwyn@Celtic Dreams <dead_souls> alright thanks!:)
[08Mar2006-14:57:28] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> welcome
[08Mar2006-15:00:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> System <error> A runtime error occurred to Phil
[08Mar2006-15:00:21] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> strange one
[08Mar2006-15:00:51] Cratylus <ds> tail /log/player_errors
[08Mar2006-15:02:07] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Woop there it is, a bug
[08Mar2006-15:02:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> /domains/town/room/training
[08Mar2006-15:02:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> try and go west
[08Mar2006-15:03:05] Cratylus <ds> heh
[08Mar2006-15:03:26] Cratylus <ds> delete exit west
[08Mar2006-15:04:06] Cratylus <ds> i dont even remember what i'd been testing with that
[08Mar2006-15:07:43] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> just an FYI.  We are only using the town as a reference
[08Mar2006-15:08:03] Cratylus <ds> yeh. thanks
[08Mar2006-15:30:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> testing
[08Mar2006-15:32:40] Cratylus <ds> passed
[08Mar2006-15:33:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> whats the darn channel emote command
[08Mar2006-15:33:41] Cratylus <ds> dsemote tests something.
[08Mar2006-15:34:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> awesome.  Never would of found it
[08Mar2006-15:34:15] Cratylus <ds> :foos.
[08Mar2006-15:34:25] Cratylus <ds> never mind that last thing
[08Mar2006-15:34:29] Cratylus <ds> it's dsemote
[08Mar2006-15:34:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i tried that
[08Mar2006-15:34:45] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> old mud was ds: tests something.
[08Mar2006-15:34:59] Cratylus <ds> yeah...i dont remember when or why that changed
[08Mar2006-15:35:29] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I was playing around with chat.c so it would be [ds] Cratylus@Dead Souls: <msg>
[08Mar2006-15:35:39] Cratylus <ds> ohhhh i rememebr actually. i let someone fix the chat daemon once
[08Mar2006-15:36:20] Cratylus <ds> yeah, they fixed a buncha stuff but woulnd up disabling the :
[08Mar2006-15:36:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yeah, thats ok
[08Mar2006-15:36:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I like the hist <channel> and list <channel> commands
[08Mar2006-15:36:58] Cratylus <ds> that's what they added :)
[08Mar2006-15:37:06] Cratylus <ds> all in all a good trade
[08Mar2006-15:58:44] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> is there a root command that shows you the object hierarchy of something?
[08Mar2006-15:58:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> showtree
[08Mar2006-16:16:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> whats the largest signed integer value one can use in LPC?
[08Mar2006-16:16:44] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> 2^32-1?
[08Mar2006-16:17:02] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> donno
[08Mar2006-16:17:10] Cratylus <ds> i dunno either
[08Mar2006-16:17:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> long it?
[08Mar2006-16:17:24] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> er longint
[08Mar2006-16:17:52] <ds> Cratylus shrugs and looks around.
[08Mar2006-16:18:22] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> 2147483646
[08Mar2006-16:18:34] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> err
[08Mar2006-16:18:38] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> 2147483647
[08Mar2006-16:18:44] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> what is the identifier for that
[08Mar2006-16:18:50] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> int, longint, etc?
[08Mar2006-16:18:52] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> (1 << 31) - 1
[08Mar2006-16:19:04] Cratylus <ds> within LPC, it's just int
[08Mar2006-16:19:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> excellent, thanks
[08Mar2006-17:03:56] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD wonders if the sizeof int changes with the platform
[08Mar2006-17:04:42] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> if i go with a 64-bit machine will I get bigger ints from mudos?
[08Mar2006-17:16:28] Cratylus <ds> how do i check int size?
[08Mar2006-17:16:40] Cratylus <ds> size limit anyway
[08Mar2006-17:17:06] Cratylus <ds> nevemind got it
[08Mar2006-17:17:48] Cratylus <ds> well i'm on a 64 bit machine and i got 2147483647, but i dont remember trying to enable compilation of a 64 bit binary
[08Mar2006-20:37:51] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, on Verbs, is there some documentation on what SetRules() is for?
[08Mar2006-20:39:11] Cratylus <ds> setting rules?
[08Mar2006-20:39:21] Cratylus <ds> hang on a sec
[08Mar2006-20:41:58] Cratylus <ds> until i finish verb docs, this is a good orientation: http://www.dnd.utwente.nl/~krimud/Docs/NMAdmin/Parser/
[08Mar2006-20:46:14] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay so the SetRule() in DS is equivalent to the parse_add_rule() function from MudOS?
[08Mar2006-20:49:49] Cratylus <ds> yip
[08Mar2006-20:50:07] Cratylus <ds> i think parse_add_rule() is lima syntax
[08Mar2006-20:50:37] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay
[08Mar2006-21:54:49] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> so when loading a verb into the system is there a special way to do it other then update <verb>.c?
[08Mar2006-21:55:01] Cratylus <ds> no
[08Mar2006-21:55:03] Cratylus <ds> why?
[08Mar2006-21:55:13] Cratylus <ds> well, you need to update the verbs daemon too
[08Mar2006-21:55:23] Cratylus <ds> /daemon/verbs.c
[08Mar2006-21:55:49] Cratylus <ds> but that's if it's a new verb
[08Mar2006-21:58:10] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I'm an idiot, it would be nice if I remember proper syntax for c
[08Mar2006-21:59:20] Cratylus <ds> creating new verbs is pretty advanced stuff for day 2 of lpc learning
[08Mar2006-21:59:55] Cratylus <ds> you some kinda genius?
[08Mar2006-22:00:09] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I've worked on various LPC's before, I'm not new to coding, I'm just trying to do some proof of concept stuff.
[08Mar2006-22:00:13] Cratylus <ds> k
[08Mar2006-22:00:27] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> re: Ashon from WheelMud project/Mudconnector/et all
[08Mar2006-22:00:35] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[08Mar2006-22:01:01] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> besides where's the fun in actually building?  BLAH!
[08Mar2006-22:01:05] Cratylus <ds> heh
[08Mar2006-22:01:13] Cratylus <ds> i never thought i'd feel that way
[08Mar2006-22:01:23] Cratylus <ds> but its getting harder to enjoy it lately, yeah
[08Mar2006-22:15:21] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay so where would I find a function listing for function calls on objects/souls/?  IE: CanManipulate(obj)...?
[08Mar2006-22:16:17] Cratylus <ds> help will do it, generally
[08Mar2006-22:16:29] Cratylus <ds> though theres an efun just for that. hang on
[08Mar2006-22:17:17] Cratylus <ds> eval return functions(load_object("/lib/player"),1)
[08Mar2006-22:17:57] Cratylus <ds> obviously that's more data than yer buffer will handle, but that's what you'd use in a function
[08Mar2006-22:19:56] Cratylus <ds> did i understand your question correctly?
[08Mar2006-22:20:08] Cratylus <ds> spending more, collecting less
[08Mar2006-22:20:10] Cratylus <ds> mischan
[08Mar2006-22:21:02] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> kinda
[08Mar2006-22:32:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> the NM documentation called them, "applies", I guess those are what I'm looking for.  I saw some in /doc/applies/ but those seem more driver type
[08Mar2006-22:33:02] Cratylus <ds> hmm
[08Mar2006-22:33:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> does that make more sense?
[08Mar2006-22:34:04] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> If it makes sense, it has no business being in a mud
[08Mar2006-22:34:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> bah, smurf village makes plenty of sense!
[08Mar2006-22:34:44] Cratylus <ds> it sounds like it makes sense, but i dont quite understand, because to me, applies are driver only
[08Mar2006-22:34:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ashon, do you guys have a working star gate?
[08Mar2006-22:35:23] Cratylus <ds> can you point me to the sepcific docs you mean?
[08Mar2006-22:36:17] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, take for example the verb: pick.c  it's has function calls such as CanManipulate(), GetParalyized(), etc.
[08Mar2006-22:36:27] Cratylus <ds> right
[08Mar2006-22:36:59] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I was wondering where I'd find a listing for those types of functions
[08Mar2006-22:37:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Thats all Nightmare/Dead Souls esque
[08Mar2006-22:37:41] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Brodbane, I gotta get all my skills/classes/races/quest system done before I even think about doing any kind of building.
[08Mar2006-22:38:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Would you like my stargate?
[08Mar2006-22:38:28] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> wouldn't hurt to take a look at it.
[08Mar2006-22:38:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I did it as an example for another mud
[08Mar2006-22:39:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You "dial earth", or "dial e", "dial a".. etc. Opens the portal briefly, then closes it
[08Mar2006-22:39:18] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> mine however has to be much more trhen just a portal.
[08Mar2006-22:40:14] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> have a preferred email?
[08Mar2006-22:43:19] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus, did you ever read the LPC manual that says "Dont use colors!!!!"?
[08Mar2006-22:43:41] Cratylus <ds> :)
[08Mar2006-22:43:47] Cratylus <ds> suck it up
[08Mar2006-22:44:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> http://www.lysator.liu.se/mud/profword.html
[08Mar2006-22:44:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hehe.  I've  been slowly removing the calls.  I like it some places thuogh
[08Mar2006-22:44:42] Cratylus <ds> lysator's been out of date for 12 years
[08Mar2006-22:44:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Yeah, you got me there
[08Mar2006-22:45:56] Cratylus <ds> well i dont mean to be insulting about it, but all the clients i use handle color ok, and part of my focus has been to make things easy to use from *inside* the mud
[08Mar2006-22:46:08] Cratylus <ds> this is a real problem for complex docs
[08Mar2006-22:46:28] Cratylus <ds> because all-white all-text makes peoples' eyes slide off documentation
[08Mar2006-22:46:34] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I was just curious. I dont look a gift horse in the mouth!
[08Mar2006-22:46:46] Cratylus <ds> well i feel a bit guilty about it, see
[08Mar2006-22:46:56] Cratylus <ds> because it offends my aesthetic sensibilities too
[08Mar2006-22:47:24] Cratylus <ds> it's one of those things where i think more people benefit from it than suffer
[08Mar2006-22:47:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> when you get right down to it, i can just make it however i like
[08Mar2006-22:48:53] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> NO!  Why would I want to help other people?  ;)
[08Mar2006-22:49:15] Cratylus <ds> ashon, stuff like GetParalyzed are functions almost always defined in lib objects or daemon objects
[08Mar2006-22:49:55] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods
[08Mar2006-22:49:59] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> defined as in commented?
[08Mar2006-22:50:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> or just fleshed out
[08Mar2006-22:50:11] Cratylus <ds> the help system will usually give you a list of function in an object, including inherited functions, if it doesnt have a help func
[08Mar2006-22:50:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Good call, case in point: help time
[08Mar2006-22:50:39] Cratylus <ds> but it's kindof a halfassed and only sometimes works
[08Mar2006-22:51:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I keep all of the source on disk so i can search it when i find unknown functions
[08Mar2006-22:51:38] Cratylus <ds> it seems to me that what youre looking for is something like a getfunctions command that will report available functions in an objec tin human readable format
[08Mar2006-22:51:54] Cratylus <ds> and i think thats a hella good idea, and it's going high on the todo list
[08Mar2006-22:51:58] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> right but a help player or help this_player or a help ob doesn't find the functions most likely to be used in a verb
[08Mar2006-22:52:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> The LPC manuals cover lots of that
[08Mar2006-22:52:46] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> or I should say used in most of the verbs available with the distro
[08Mar2006-22:52:48] Cratylus <ds> but right now, there isnt something as convenient as that available for me to point you to. the best i can do for right this minute is suggest that you can cobble up something dirty with functions() while i work on a more reliable command
[08Mar2006-22:54:41] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> in one day I've added two projects high up in your todo list, gosh I feel special.
[08Mar2006-22:54:47] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis smirks
[08Mar2006-22:54:51] Cratylus <ds> yeah wtf
[08Mar2006-22:54:59] Cratylus <ds> you dont need to be this precocious
[08Mar2006-22:55:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Yeah, i've got like 10 in the "do next year" stack
[08Mar2006-22:56:01] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> someones gotta help drive development, right?
[08Mar2006-22:56:29] Cratylus <ds> :) that's why i want people to use the lib. i cant find all this shit on my own
[08Mar2006-22:56:45] Cratylus <ds> dont let my grumbling fool you. i very much appreciate the comments
[08Mar2006-22:57:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> He wouldn't hang out in this channel unless he liked the abuse
[08Mar2006-22:57:11] Cratylus <ds> :)
[08Mar2006-22:57:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> If i can swing it, we should have a few more seasoned lpc guys here.  None of my guys mind answering questions/helping
[08Mar2006-22:58:04] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> well, calling me precocious I take as a compliment.  ;)
[08Mar2006-22:58:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Expealidocious?
[08Mar2006-22:59:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I was doing work on TMI-2/Lima/Heaven 7 something like 10 years ago, and then shifted into writing my own.  But b/c of certain problems that come with .NET 2.0 dev has stopped, and I've got some concept proofs to work out.
[08Mar2006-22:59:58] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I just can't remember enough of LPC to get me where I should be.
[08Mar2006-23:00:34] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I may alias all the common reference functions. Ie this_player->() = TP()
[08Mar2006-23:00:40] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> and everything USED to be in a STD folder not broken up in a logical (to someone, I assume) file structure
[08Mar2006-23:00:49] Cratylus <ds> yknow i've been wondering if i should put that in the lib
[08Mar2006-23:01:15] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> EN = environment
[08Mar2006-23:01:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i could get the defs file i made a while back, if it would be useful
[08Mar2006-23:01:45] Cratylus <ds> back when i was a padewan, i was on a mud where instead of this_player()->GetName() you'd do stuff like TP->GCN
[08Mar2006-23:02:01] Cratylus <ds> very convenient, but i wonder if it doesnt make lpc harder to learn
[08Mar2006-23:02:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yes and no, once you figure it out - its just easier
[08Mar2006-23:04:44] Cratylus <ds> hiya pulsar. you can use this channel for questions and stuff
[08Mar2006-23:05:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus, i'm going to email you my defs.h
[08Mar2006-23:05:14] Pulsar@Solinar <dead_souls> ?
[08Mar2006-23:05:28] Cratylus <ds> this is an intermud channel between dead souls muds
[08Mar2006-23:05:44] Cratylus <ds> you'll hear lots of stuff that isnt directed at you specifically
[08Mar2006-23:05:54] Pulsar@Solinar <dead_souls> right, i figured as much - how do i turn it off?
[08Mar2006-23:06:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ds
[08Mar2006-23:06:08] Cratylus <ds> type: ds
[08Mar2006-23:06:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> there is a "hey nice to meet you" first question:)
[08Mar2006-23:06:32] Cratylus <ds> heh cant blame him
[08Mar2006-23:06:48] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> there's partial documentation for an 'addlimb' and 'removelimb' commandset...  do those work?  removed?  ??
[08Mar2006-23:06:50] Cratylus <ds> some people need total silence to develp stuff
[08Mar2006-23:06:52] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah some people are using it as a gossip channel!
[08Mar2006-23:07:19] Cratylus <ds> dhavid, AddLimb and RemoveLimb do indeed work
[08Mar2006-23:07:27] Pulsar@Solinar <dead_souls> thanks, i haven't done ANYTHING in the mudding world in a loooong time, stumbled across this on Wikipedia and thought i'd check it out, but - lol - all the chatter makes it hard to read the docs...
[08Mar2006-23:07:29] Cratylus <ds> but they arent really command-based
[08Mar2006-23:08:01] Cratylus <ds> pulsar, your mud automatically logs ds channls, so you can just read what you missed in /log/chan/ds
[08Mar2006-23:08:55] Cratylus <ds> dhavid, to add limbs and remove them from a specific crature, you would use the AddLimb() and RemoveLimb() functions that exist in that creature's body
[08Mar2006-23:09:11] Cratylus <ds> but if what youre trying to do is amke humans have tails, that's something else
[08Mar2006-23:09:31] Cratylus <ds> for something like that you need to edit the race file in /secure/cfg/races
[08Mar2006-23:10:01] Cratylus <ds> then use admintool to remove humans as a race, and then add them back in
[08Mar2006-23:10:26] Cratylus <ds> does that answer your question?
[08Mar2006-23:10:28] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> well not really have tails...  more along the lines of makings humans and/or all races have about 4-5 more limbs each...
[08Mar2006-23:10:36] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> yes it does...  ima do that...  thx
[08Mar2006-23:10:50] Cratylus <ds> ohh yes, this is the thing where you want wrists and ankles and such
[08Mar2006-23:11:00] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> heh, uh huh
[08Mar2006-23:11:22] Cratylus <ds> listen, i think that's cool and everything, but it really is a bigger project than it sounds
[08Mar2006-23:11:40] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> yeah i know...  i'm just havin fun playin around...  ima see what happens
[08Mar2006-23:12:38] Cratylus <ds> if you want to make it so people can wear anklets and stuff, you'll need to do modifications to /lib/body.c, /lib/std/armor.c and /include/armor_types.h
[08Mar2006-23:13:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> not quite as easy as adding wear location flags like in ROM.
[08Mar2006-23:13:26] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis chortles.
[08Mar2006-23:13:47] Cratylus <ds> the big problem with this is that if you hose up the body.c object, for example, if you log out, you may not be able to log back in
[08Mar2006-23:13:57] Cratylus <ds> so make sure you make lots of backups
[08Mar2006-23:14:15] Dhavid@Chalice <dead_souls> i have a directory of about 70 backups so far...heh
[08Mar2006-23:14:21] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[08Mar2006-23:14:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> bk command is nice
[08Mar2006-23:14:47] Cratylus <ds> it needs some finessing, but yeah, it does the job pretty well
[08Mar2006-23:15:07] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls>  i like it because i'm lazy
[08Mar2006-23:15:15] Cratylus <ds> i made it because i'm lazy
[08Mar2006-23:18:42] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> welp, I'm going afk for a couple of hours.
[08Mar2006-23:19:33] <dead_souls> Cratylus@Frontiers waves.
[08Mar2006-23:31:20] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I've been trying to use the ftp directory.  But files suddenly become 'read only' and screw up the ftp client
[08Mar2006-23:33:21] Cratylus <ds> weird
[08Mar2006-23:33:29] Cratylus <ds> what OS?
[08Mar2006-23:33:39] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> win32
[08Mar2006-23:33:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> xp
[08Mar2006-23:33:47] Cratylus <ds> ntfs?
[08Mar2006-23:33:49] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yes
[08Mar2006-23:34:09] Cratylus <ds> my guess is the problem might be there
[08Mar2006-23:35:56] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> The mud seems to make all files read only, including directories
[08Mar2006-23:36:10] Cratylus <ds> thats a new one on me
[08Mar2006-23:36:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm
[08Mar2006-23:36:36] Cratylus <ds> but you can edit and save stuff, right? you mean the ftp client does this
[08Mar2006-23:36:50] Cratylus <ds> s/client/server
[08Mar2006-23:37:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i can edit stuff, yes
[08Mar2006-23:37:28] Cratylus <ds> whew ok
[08Mar2006-23:37:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> the issues is ftp
[08Mar2006-23:37:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> issues = issue
[08Mar2006-23:38:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> not the internal one, a third party
[08Mar2006-23:38:20] Cratylus <ds> oh
[08Mar2006-23:38:48] Cratylus <ds> !(my code) == !(my problem)
[08Mar2006-23:40:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i've confirmed it on two machines.  All files within c:\ds are read-only
[08Mar2006-23:41:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> and are constantly reattribed
[08Mar2006-23:41:13] Cratylus <ds> that's interesting
[08Mar2006-23:41:31] Cratylus <ds> that tends to creep into (my problem) territory
[08Mar2006-23:41:37] Cratylus <ds> almost
[08Mar2006-23:41:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yes, its almost bordering on a lib issue
[08Mar2006-23:42:05] Cratylus <ds> for one thing it sounds like this is probably a source of cpu/iowait overhead
[08Mar2006-23:42:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'm sure its taxing
[08Mar2006-23:42:28] Cratylus <ds> what's the cpu use on the driver process?
[08Mar2006-23:42:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> one sec
[08Mar2006-23:42:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'll get up the perf mon
[08Mar2006-23:44:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> idle mud (no connections) is running at less then a percent
[08Mar2006-23:44:40] Cratylus <ds> mmkay
[08Mar2006-23:45:02] Cratylus <ds> well i have bad news
[08Mar2006-23:45:22] Cratylus <ds> i have nfc at all why you're making read only files
[08Mar2006-23:45:53] Cratylus <ds> hmm
[08Mar2006-23:45:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> very strange indeed.  My home computer was just reinstalled
[08Mar2006-23:45:59] Cratylus <ds> hang on
[08Mar2006-23:46:41] Cratylus <ds> well your files must be read-write for the file owner
[08Mar2006-23:47:07] Cratylus <ds> and if theyre not, ther emust be some sort of win32 feature that forces read write for owners
[08Mar2006-23:47:17] Cratylus <ds> otherwise you couldnt run at all
[08Mar2006-23:47:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok, i can understand that much
[08Mar2006-23:47:53] Cratylus <ds> the proble you're describing just might also exist on the unix version
[08Mar2006-23:48:31] Cratylus <ds> this third party app, is it running under the same user as your mud process?
[08Mar2006-23:48:54] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> the server is filezilla, its running as a service under local system
[08Mar2006-23:49:10] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i checked my file permissions. Owner/Creator has no rights checked
[08Mar2006-23:49:24] Cratylus <ds> i dont know that terminology, but it sounds like theres a user id conflict
[08Mar2006-23:49:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> true, very true
[08Mar2006-23:49:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i can change its user
[08Mar2006-23:49:56] Cratylus <ds> basically, my gues is that if your ftp server ran as administrator or as the mud file owner, you'd have no prob
[08Mar2006-23:50:36] Cratylus <ds> from looking at the unix version of dead souls, the same problem would probably occur there if an unprivileged user tried to wrote to the ds directory
[08Mar2006-23:50:56] Cratylus <ds> thing is, i'm not sure that's a "problem" so much as intended behavior
[08Mar2006-23:51:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yeah yeah, its a feature
[08Mar2006-23:51:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> security feature
[08Mar2006-23:52:00] Cratylus <ds> i dont think it's OS specific or DS specific
[08Mar2006-23:52:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You would think "local system" trumps users
[08Mar2006-23:52:33] Cratylus <ds> ahh now we're into the metaphysics of windows
[08Mar2006-23:52:47] Cratylus <ds> thats well beyond my capacity to understand
[08Mar2006-23:52:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> well that worked
[08Mar2006-23:53:01] Cratylus <ds> groovy
[08Mar2006-23:53:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok, new faq section. Third party ftp support
[08Mar2006-23:53:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Filezilla: Run it as the same user you launch the mud from
[08Mar2006-23:53:31] Cratylus <ds> heh. i dont even support the built in ftp server
[08Mar2006-23:53:45] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i know, but its vital and a half
[08Mar2006-23:53:45] Cratylus <ds> but yeah, i'll throw it into the faq
[08Mar2006-23:53:59] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Filezilla = free, on source forge as well
[08Mar2006-23:54:15] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[09Mar2006-01:24:13] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Anyone notice how cryptic the error messages are?  My old mudos mud had actual line references..
[09Mar2006-02:00:01] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah.
[09Mar2006-07:55:25] Cratylus <ds> do you mean you're used to more output that what's described here? http://dead-souls.sourceforge.net/debugging.html
[09Mar2006-11:46:36] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> *yawn* morning.
[09Mar2006-14:12:39] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> quiet day today?
[09Mar2006-14:38:39] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> is there a reason that there isn't a base obj.h that all the other objects inherit?
[09Mar2006-15:37:09] Cratylus <ds> most tangible objects inherit /lib/std/item.c
[09Mar2006-15:46:26] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods.
[09Mar2006-15:46:52] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> found it by following the inheritance scheme.
[09Mar2006-15:57:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> that's where 95% of the lfuns that are relevant to verbs are anyhow.
[09Mar2006-15:57:15] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> that's two problems down for me.
[09Mar2006-19:01:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> the error logs need a timestamp!
[09Mar2006-19:07:32] Cratylus <ds> heh
[09Mar2006-19:07:40] Cratylus <ds> i just coded that 30 minutes ago
[09Mar2006-19:07:48] Cratylus <ds> it'll be in the next release
[09Mar2006-19:08:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> sweet.
[09Mar2006-19:08:32] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> what did you code?
[09Mar2006-19:08:42] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Cratylus(tm) now the with Precognition abilities.
[09Mar2006-19:09:15] Cratylus <ds> http://dead-souls.net/master.c
[09Mar2006-19:09:35] Cratylus <ds> you can pop that over your current master.c and your error logs will have timestamps
[09Mar2006-19:09:49] Cratylus <ds> but you should bk /secure/daemon/master just in case
[09Mar2006-19:13:36] Cratylus <ds> another new feature in that master.c is what brodbane was requesting before: mor explicit error messages on update
[09Mar2006-19:29:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, quick I hope question.  I got my verb finally compiling.  But it keeps spitting out results from an copy of the verb
[09Mar2006-19:30:27] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> and I can't figure out how to get the phantasmal result from haunting me.
[09Mar2006-19:31:04] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> do I have unload/dest the verb daemon or something?
[09Mar2006-19:34:23] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> try rehashing it
[09Mar2006-19:34:35] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> the verb dir that is
[09Mar2006-19:34:41] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods
[09Mar2006-19:35:55] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> still no
[09Mar2006-19:38:30] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> did that work?
[09Mar2006-19:38:38] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> nope.
[09Mar2006-19:38:48] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> then reboot :p
[09Mar2006-19:55:01] Cratylus <ds> ok i'm back
[09Mar2006-19:55:11] Cratylus <ds> can you explain the problem in more detail?
[09Mar2006-19:55:43] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> un segunda
[09Mar2006-19:57:16] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, so I've been trying to get this verb to just put out some test responses.
[09Mar2006-19:57:28] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> which I've gotten to work.
[09Mar2006-19:57:56] Cratylus <ds> mkay
[09Mar2006-19:57:56] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> but I'm getting the failure message at the same time, which no longer exists in the current .c file
[09Mar2006-19:58:12] Cratylus <ds> what's the name of the verb?
[09Mar2006-19:58:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> repair
[09Mar2006-19:58:28] Cratylus <ds> hmm
[09Mar2006-19:59:08] Cratylus <ds> sometimes, if a verb is updated in one location, then moved to another, then updated again, this can happen
[09Mar2006-19:59:14] Cratylus <ds> does that sound plausible in this case?
[09Mar2006-19:59:41] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yes, for someone reason it appeared in cmd/players
[09Mar2006-19:59:55] Cratylus <ds> does that file exist currently?
[09Mar2006-19:59:59] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> no
[09Mar2006-20:00:29] Cratylus <ds> try: update /daemon/verbs
[09Mar2006-20:00:55] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> still getting the phantam response.
[09Mar2006-20:01:17] Cratylus <ds> give me 5 minutes
[09Mar2006-20:01:53] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods
[09Mar2006-20:02:45] Jezu@The Hollow <dead_souls> are you behind a firewall, ashon?
[09Mar2006-20:03:24] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> might be
[09Mar2006-20:05:00] Cratylus <ds> i'm reproducing the problem. so far so good
[09Mar2006-20:05:58] Cratylus <ds> hmmm
[09Mar2006-20:06:19] Cratylus <ds> when i create conflicting verbs, the lst one updated appears to take precedence
[09Mar2006-20:06:33] Cratylus <ds> do you have shell access to your mud platform?
[09Mar2006-20:07:01] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> just running the windows version @ home for dev
[09Mar2006-20:07:09] Cratylus <ds> heh
[09Mar2006-20:07:31] Cratylus <ds> would you mind opening an explorer window and searching the ds dir for repair.c?
[09Mar2006-20:07:43] Cratylus <ds> i'd like to know how many currently exist
[09Mar2006-20:08:01] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> does the windows version actually work well?
[09Mar2006-20:08:05] Cratylus <ds> just like unix
[09Mar2006-20:08:15] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> haven't had any problems with it yet.
[09Mar2006-20:08:21] Cratylus <ds> a player or creator sees no diffrerence unless they run the version command
[09Mar2006-20:08:33] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> nice
[09Mar2006-20:08:47] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> so ls and stuff is still there?
[09Mar2006-20:08:55] Cratylus <ds> it's the exact same mud
[09Mar2006-20:09:01] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> of course.
[09Mar2006-20:12:04] Cratylus <ds> ok, run this: eval return load_object("/daemon/verbs")->GetVerbs()["use"]
[09Mar2006-20:12:10] Cratylus <ds> ok, run this: eval return load_object("/daemon/verbs")->GetVerbs()["repair"]
[09Mar2006-20:12:18] Cratylus <ds> sorry, "use" was my test verb over here
[09Mar2006-20:12:28] Cratylus <ds> ok, run this: eval return load_object("/daemon/verbs")->GetVerbs()["zap"]
[09Mar2006-20:12:37] Cratylus <ds> Oh fer FUCK sake
[09Mar2006-20:13:03] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Result = "/verbs/players/repair.c
[09Mar2006-20:13:37] Cratylus <ds> did you do a search for repair.c ?
[09Mar2006-20:14:11] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah, it's only in the /verbs/players, except for a .bak made by the bk cmd
[09Mar2006-20:14:27] Cratylus <ds> ok, here's what i think should happen
[09Mar2006-20:15:17] Cratylus <ds> erm
[09Mar2006-20:15:29] Cratylus <ds> mind if i log into yer mud?
[09Mar2006-20:16:04] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> np
[09Mar2006-20:16:54] Cratylus <ds> i think jezu is right. i think you're firewalled
[09Mar2006-20:17:20] Cratylus <ds> the reason i want to log in is that i'm not able to replicate your exact problem
[09Mar2006-20:17:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> 216.254.22.116
[09Mar2006-20:17:36] Cratylus <ds> i can make divergent versions of verbs, but the last one i update is the one that takes precedence
[09Mar2006-20:18:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> lemme reconfig my firewall
[09Mar2006-20:20:59] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> are you using a router?
[09Mar2006-20:21:55] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah, just gotta do some port fowarding
[09Mar2006-20:22:01] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> cool
[09Mar2006-20:24:54] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay should be fowarded now.
[09Mar2006-20:25:45] Cratylus <ds> i'm trying 216.254.22.113 6666 and 216.254.22.116 6666 but no dice
[09Mar2006-20:27:17] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> try again
[09Mar2006-20:27:41] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> on the .113
[09Mar2006-20:39:25] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, I got bubmped around by all the portable devices in the house, should work now
[09Mar2006-20:59:13] Cratylus <ds> for those interested, it's a documentation issue. i will make things clearer in upcoming verb creation docs
[09Mar2006-20:59:29] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> UPCOMING?
[09Mar2006-20:59:35] Cratylus <ds> hey im just the one guy
[09Mar2006-21:00:13] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I'm just disappointed that there really isn't any help on the web about doing lpc verbs.
[09Mar2006-21:00:21] Cratylus <ds> you're not the only one
[09Mar2006-21:00:37] Cratylus <ds> lack of verb documentation is thing #2 that killed lpc development
[09Mar2006-21:00:45] Cratylus <ds> thing #1, imo, is ed
[09Mar2006-21:01:05] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I think ed is fine, once you learn how to use it.
[09Mar2006-21:01:27] Cratylus <ds> thats because your brain has integrated with it
[09Mar2006-21:01:37] Cratylus <ds> for new people, it's not so grokkable
[09Mar2006-21:01:41] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I had to write my first massive game in ed for my comp sci weeder class back in college so I learned how to operate it pretty smoothly.
[09Mar2006-21:01:47] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> true.
[09Mar2006-21:02:28] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> don't go far cratylus, I got some more verb related questions, but I gotta grab a quick smoke.
[09Mar2006-21:02:42] Cratylus <ds> k. i'm afk for a few minutes too
[09Mar2006-21:05:26] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Meh, I skip ed and use shell, makes life a lot easier when you're used to that in other projects
[09Mar2006-21:05:37] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I did all my coding on a diku mud thru shell pretty much
[09Mar2006-21:06:33] Cratylus <ds> for standard stuff i use vi, for complex projects i use gvim. ed is a last resort to me
[09Mar2006-21:06:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah, well I chose a windows based lib so I can just use visual studio and multitask while I'm at it.
[09Mar2006-21:06:57] Cratylus <ds> i figure i'm an old fart and *i* feel that way, new people must despise it
[09Mar2006-21:07:01] Cratylus <ds> hence, qcs
[09Mar2006-21:07:11] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> mmmm vi
[09Mar2006-21:07:23] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> man, you guys like hurtin yourself :p
[09Mar2006-21:07:35] Cratylus <ds> no i actually really like vi
[09Mar2006-21:07:51] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> lemme correct myself, I'll use pico for somethin quick, and jedit for somethin large
[09Mar2006-21:07:55] Cratylus <ds> once you get a feel for it, it's awesome for code development
[09Mar2006-21:08:03] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I see vi like I see ed I think
[09Mar2006-21:08:13] Cratylus <ds> well let me make a correction
[09Mar2006-21:08:27] Cratylus <ds> "official" vi lacks stuff
[09Mar2006-21:08:31] Cratylus <ds> vim r0x
[09Mar2006-21:08:48] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> lol
[09Mar2006-21:09:28] Cratylus <ds> i went from vi to vim and was floored to discover that if you highlight a bracket, then type "%", your cursor jumps to the matching opposite bracket in the code
[09Mar2006-21:09:40] Cratylus <ds> i pretty much creamed my pants right there
[09Mar2006-21:09:56] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> holy crap, ya, that's nice, that's why I like jedit
[09Mar2006-21:19:45] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay so I put the repair.c in event, just basically cp'd bury.c from that folder and changed the text from direct_bury_obj_... to direct_repair_obj, rebooted the mud (so I didn't have to reload everything) and am still getting the same error.
[09Mar2006-21:32:59] Cratylus <ds> ya
[09Mar2006-21:33:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> -_-
[09Mar2006-21:33:59] Cratylus <ds> any object that inherits /lib/events/repair needs a recursive update or reload for the new inheritable to take effect
[09Mar2006-21:34:42] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> which is why I did the reboot.
[09Mar2006-21:34:46] Cratylus <ds> oh
[09Mar2006-21:34:52] Cratylus <ds> hang on
[09Mar2006-21:35:48] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I gotta add a call from lib.h and LIB_REPAIR to item.c don't I?
[09Mar2006-21:36:26] Cratylus <ds> hmmmmmmmm
[09Mar2006-21:53:41] Cratylus <ds> woohoo sixteen ds muds online at once. a record.
[09Mar2006-21:53:47] Cratylus <ds> mudlist -m dead
[09Mar2006-21:55:26] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Nice
[09Mar2006-22:10:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I must say that Cratylus here is one of the best lib dev's I've had the joy of working with.
[09Mar2006-22:11:13] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> he will start hating me soon, if he hasn't already, because I'm trying to get past the learning curve so quickly.
[09Mar2006-22:14:09] Cratylus <ds> heh
[09Mar2006-22:14:32] Cratylus <ds> well yer way way way way ahead of anything i expected at this point
[09Mar2006-22:14:46] Cratylus <ds> good motivator
[09Mar2006-22:15:34] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I'm just trying to get a prove that with lpc one can create a quest based mud where all of the quest are interesting and dynamically created.
[09Mar2006-22:15:46] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> nothing big.
[09Mar2006-22:15:50] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis sighs.
[09Mar2006-22:16:02] Cratylus <ds> i have zero knowledge of rom/circle/diku/smaug/etc
[09Mar2006-22:16:26] Cratylus <ds> so i cant say lpc is better
[09Mar2006-22:16:30] Cratylus <ds> but i like it
[09Mar2006-22:16:48] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Eh, personal preference, it's kinda like which programming language is better or who's hotter
[09Mar2006-22:16:50] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> LPC is better b/c of the interpreted code.
[09Mar2006-22:18:43] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay well I'm gonna log, let things stew.  But I'm having trouble getting lfuns to work in my verbs.
[09Mar2006-22:18:49] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis waves.
[09Mar2006-22:20:53] <ds> Cratylus waves.
[09Mar2006-23:59:09] Cratylus <ds> looks like intermud is back up
[10Mar2006-02:51:14] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> does it always go down late at night?
[10Mar2006-05:56:24] Cratylus <ds> not normally
[10Mar2006-05:56:54] Cratylus <ds> it's been extra flaky the past couple of weeks
[10Mar2006-09:49:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Good morning guys
[10Mar2006-09:51:22] Cratylus <ds> hiya
[10Mar2006-09:52:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Hey Cratylus, if you make a change to interactive.c, and then do a update -r interactive.c... what would you be missing to get the changes to propogate
[10Mar2006-09:52:27] Cratylus <ds> it depends on what you're trying to do
[10Mar2006-09:52:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> eventDescribeEnvironment
[10Mar2006-09:53:01] Cratylus <ds> if you want your character to use the new stuff, you need to update -r /lib/creator, then log out and log back in
[10Mar2006-09:54:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> excellent. I knew i missed something
[10Mar2006-09:54:11] Cratylus <ds> btw to see what changes have been implemented in the development mud, log into dead-souls.net 6666 and read /doc/RELEASE_NOTES
[10Mar2006-09:55:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Oh my gosh, your level of throughness threatens me
[10Mar2006-09:55:27] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-09:55:46] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I am threatened by an strong male
[10Mar2006-09:55:56] Cratylus <ds> the RELEASE_NOTES on dead-souls.net have stuff not on your mud
[10Mar2006-10:02:46] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I guess Crats is a similar age to me for that reference
[10Mar2006-10:02:56] <ds> Cratylus smirks.
[10Mar2006-10:03:06] Cratylus <ds> walk this way...
[10Mar2006-10:03:24] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ahahah, the more brilliant piece of comic genius ever filmed
[10Mar2006-10:03:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm, i'm going to have to start noting our changes Ptah.  Every mudlib upgrade is going to be abear
[10Mar2006-10:03:38] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> lets just not upgrade then
[10Mar2006-10:03:46] Cratylus <ds> unfortunately yes, if you make a lot of lib customization
[10Mar2006-10:03:48] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> But i like whats in his notes
[10Mar2006-10:04:18] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Damnit, now I have to rent that movie this weekend
[10Mar2006-10:04:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> When we do upgrades i'm not going to jump on them
[10Mar2006-10:04:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'm going to setup a mirror server
[10Mar2006-10:04:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> so we can review
[10Mar2006-10:04:52] Cratylus <ds> you're not the only one this bothers
[10Mar2006-10:05:04] Cratylus <ds> there are a couple of muds still at r8
[10Mar2006-10:05:41] Cratylus <ds> they tend to drop off the mudlist because r8 doesnt have the intermud keepalive
[10Mar2006-10:07:27] Cratylus <ds> still, i figure i'd rather be obnoxious for too many fixes and updates than not enough
[10Mar2006-10:08:09] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> We could write something that would re-apply our changes Brod.  Kinda an upgrade engine
[10Mar2006-10:08:44] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> do a dif, we segment our code off with specific comments
[10Mar2006-10:12:29] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Zmud V7.21 is very nice.  If anyone was looking into *buying* it.
[10Mar2006-10:13:31] Cratylus <ds> yeh, when i have to use windows, i use an old zmud from pre-nazi days
[10Mar2006-10:13:45] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Nazi's didnt charge for their services
[10Mar2006-10:13:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I was using it, but i found it to do a couple of things that really irratated me
[10Mar2006-10:13:55] Cratylus <ds> doesnt try to authenticate with Big Money Guy
[10Mar2006-10:14:17] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Powah to the people!  Down with whitey!
[10Mar2006-10:14:36] Cratylus <ds> when the revolution comes, zugg will be first up against the wall
[10Mar2006-10:14:50] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Mine doesnt communicate with him.. how odd
[10Mar2006-10:15:20] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Man... the Dennis Milleresque references from the past, I am gonna have to keep on my toes around you
[10Mar2006-10:15:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'm a welp, so i'll just overlook your grown up references
[10Mar2006-10:16:10] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Brodbane is like a doughboy with a Chenault when it comes to our witty repertoire
[10Mar2006-10:16:30] Cratylus <ds> i'm not engaging in some kinda cultural reference arms race
[10Mar2006-10:16:56] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I have google you know
[10Mar2006-10:17:12] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> and now, google has you
[10Mar2006-10:17:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> http://www.kmtdesigns.com/kenandheidi.jpg
[10Mar2006-10:17:57] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Sexy! Very hot!  And the girls' ok too
[10Mar2006-10:18:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Yeah, she just had a baby
[10Mar2006-10:18:23] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> you poor poor fool
[10Mar2006-10:18:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> that picture is now 4 years old
[10Mar2006-10:18:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i was sexier then
[10Mar2006-10:20:27] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> after 3 kids and the loss of 4 years of sleep between those babies... I have nothing but evil delight at the pain new parents go through
[10Mar2006-10:20:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Pain? My wife does all the work
[10Mar2006-10:20:27] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> That'll change
[10Mar2006-10:20:27] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> or you'll be single, either or, still pain
[10Mar2006-10:22:12] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Our baby is easssy-mode. I'm convinced that i'm not her father
[10Mar2006-10:22:32] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ok, not touching that one
[10Mar2006-10:23:42] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> morning folks.
[10Mar2006-10:24:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Hello
[10Mar2006-10:24:03] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Who are you, I do not recognize your IDC
[10Mar2006-10:24:29] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> oh I've been around for quite awhile.
[10Mar2006-10:24:53] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Which one is McGuyver on?
[10Mar2006-10:24:57] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> CLOSE THE IRIS!
[10Mar2006-10:25:01] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> yeah
[10Mar2006-10:25:05] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> er, sg1
[10Mar2006-10:27:00] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> er mistell
[10Mar2006-10:28:24] Cratylus <ds> ashon was just workin on yer email
[10Mar2006-10:28:34] Cratylus <ds> ill send you what ive done so far
[10Mar2006-10:29:06] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> w00t!
[10Mar2006-10:29:16] Cratylus <ds> i think you need to add a check to that line 21
[10Mar2006-10:29:38] Cratylus <ds> something like if(ob && ob->GetDamagePoints())
[10Mar2006-10:30:59] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay but in the can_ I wanna check if the damagepoints() > 0 before they actually do anything to it.
[10Mar2006-10:31:23] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> i think that can_ functions tend to distort the arg type they get...it's not clear to me that it will be a reliable thing to try to do in a can_
[10Mar2006-10:32:03] Cratylus <ds> some checks have to happen in do_ funcs, as counterintuitive as it seems
[10Mar2006-10:32:17] Cratylus <ds> read: "stupid as it seems"
[10Mar2006-10:33:40] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> mooch da nooch
[10Mar2006-10:33:44] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> but a quick check in other verbs seems that most of them are doing some to a lot of checks in the can
[10Mar2006-10:33:48] Cratylus <ds> yes
[10Mar2006-10:33:52] Cratylus <ds> simple checks
[10Mar2006-10:34:06] Cratylus <ds> stuff with this_player() and stuff
[10Mar2006-10:34:26] Cratylus <ds> not usually with non-string types as arguments
[10Mar2006-10:35:06] Cratylus <ds> if you do see that, either it is irrelevant to the logic of the check, or the verb author got lucky and wrote a bug that works
[10Mar2006-10:35:56] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> that doesn't make sense!
[10Mar2006-10:36:04] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis starts sobbing.
[10Mar2006-10:36:04] Cratylus <ds> it *almost* does
[10Mar2006-10:36:24] Cratylus <ds> i'm not going to defend a parser design that isnt mine, but i think i know what they were getting at
[10Mar2006-10:37:17] Cratylus <ds> the can_ funcs are supposed to do basic checks of the type "can the person calling this verb physically access the object being worked on, and/or is there something hosed/wrong about this person that should invalidate the verb"
[10Mar2006-10:37:37] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> the can_ functionality should handle int returns just as easy as string returns
[10Mar2006-10:37:57] Cratylus <ds> mmm i'll need more information to understand that
[10Mar2006-10:38:09] Cratylus <ds> oh you mean args
[10Mar2006-10:38:15] Cratylus <ds> yeah, "should"
[10Mar2006-10:38:55] Cratylus <ds> but i dont rely on them to do so. maybe you'll find some feature of them i missed
[10Mar2006-10:39:13] Cratylus <ds> but if you dont. just do your complex checks in the do_funcs
[10Mar2006-10:39:31] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I expect this problem to be fixed in the next release. </sarcasm>
[10Mar2006-10:39:35] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-10:39:49] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> just change every skill check to rock paper sissors
[10Mar2006-10:39:51] Cratylus <ds> parser design is way above my pay grade. it's all i can do to just understand it
[10Mar2006-10:40:18] Cratylus <ds> the last parser bug i fixed, i have no idea how i did it
[10Mar2006-10:40:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay so simple checks to this_player, and nothing else.
[10Mar2006-10:40:34] Cratylus <ds> pretty much ya
[10Mar2006-10:42:38] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Agggh!  It worked moving it too the do_
[10Mar2006-10:43:06] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Now I must hunt down Descartes and kill him slowly.  George Reese, I am coming for you!
[10Mar2006-10:43:36] Cratylus <ds> heh he's not smart enough to design the parser either
[10Mar2006-10:43:43] Cratylus <ds> its mudos stuff
[10Mar2006-10:46:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> so now that I've gotten over the "little" bumps in the road, I should be cranking out verbs like crazy today.  Good.
[10Mar2006-10:46:31] Cratylus <ds> i'm not scheduled to go anywhere today so i'll prolly be around to help
[10Mar2006-10:46:55] Cratylus <ds> i must say that's the fastest verb learning curve climb i've ever seen
[10Mar2006-10:47:18] Cratylus <ds> took me months to sweat it out
[10Mar2006-10:48:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> shuuu, wait till you get to adverbs
[10Mar2006-10:48:02] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Today verbs, tomorrow the Parser!
[10Mar2006-10:48:26] Cratylus <ds> damn dud, if you get leet enough to play with the parser i'll friggin pay you a salary
[10Mar2006-10:49:00] Cratylus <ds> hope you accept gummy bears and pocket lint and legal tender
[10Mar2006-10:49:16] Cratylus <ds> s/and legal/as legal
[10Mar2006-10:49:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Do what I do, pay your guys with the money tree..
[10Mar2006-10:49:26] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I wrote the command parser for my Wheelmud project.
[10Mar2006-10:49:52] Cratylus <ds> c++?
[10Mar2006-10:50:00] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> which is not an interpreted code parser.
[10Mar2006-10:50:10] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah right.  VB
[10Mar2006-10:50:14] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-10:50:45] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Heh, I did the same thing as a Proof of concept for a rules engine
[10Mar2006-10:50:45] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> with .net it's a viable programming language.  so let's not go there.
[10Mar2006-10:50:49] Cratylus <ds> i'd look into the parser myself for real but it involves knowing what i'm doing with c++ and i only have this one lifetime
[10Mar2006-10:51:11] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You're in luck, all I do is C++
[10Mar2006-10:51:21] <ds> Cratylus smiles.
[10Mar2006-10:51:29] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> real men use C and nothing but pointers
[10Mar2006-10:51:31] Cratylus <ds> you better hope i forget you said that
[10Mar2006-10:51:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Is mudos source with the lib?
[10Mar2006-10:52:03] Cratylus <ds> yip
[10Mar2006-10:52:13] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ohhh, pandora's box is calling me
[10Mar2006-10:52:21] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I wont mention I do C unix programming then either
[10Mar2006-10:52:23] Cratylus <ds> the cygwin-modified source comes with the windows version too
[10Mar2006-10:52:53] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> its worth checking out
[10Mar2006-10:52:53] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> FEATURE REQUEST: Have the previous days ds channels renamed and backed up for easy reference!
[10Mar2006-10:52:59] Cratylus <ds> its practically the same as the unix source, just a few lines changed here and there
[10Mar2006-10:54:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> If i'm going to burn time, i'm going to do a mud socket project
[10Mar2006-10:54:56] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> and revamp our intermud communication with some peer to peer activity
[10Mar2006-10:55:22] Cratylus <ds> that would be worth a dispensation
[10Mar2006-10:55:30] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> does the current mudos use interrupts for connections and incoming data events?
[10Mar2006-10:55:38] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-10:55:44] Cratylus <ds> let me know when you find out
[10Mar2006-10:56:04] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i doubt its asynchronous
[10Mar2006-10:56:18] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> ack, sockets, might as well go through recode the mudos sockets and throw in some apartment threading while your at it.
[10Mar2006-10:56:22] Cratylus <ds> if you ask in a non-lazy sounding way, intercre sometimes has people with helpful answers to such qustions
[10Mar2006-10:56:30] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Well, if you just pound read() it pegs the cpu
[10Mar2006-10:56:46] Cratylus <ds> do not mention threading and mudos in the same breath on intercre tho
[10Mar2006-10:56:59] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> FORK() that!
[10Mar2006-10:57:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> FYI, board 'read' is bugged
[10Mar2006-10:57:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> if you just do a 'read' it throws a nice error
[10Mar2006-10:57:23] Cratylus <ds> yeh? doesnt surprise me
[10Mar2006-10:57:33] Cratylus <ds> i think it still uses an add_action, right?
[10Mar2006-10:57:55] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Yes
[10Mar2006-10:58:03] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> read and post are add_actions
[10Mar2006-10:58:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> The mud needs a better efun then add_action
[10Mar2006-10:58:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> such as add_checked_action
[10Mar2006-10:58:19] Cratylus <ds> i'll verbidy boards. not top priority tho
[10Mar2006-10:58:25] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> that actually does the idiot proofing in advance
[10Mar2006-10:58:27] Cratylus <ds> verbify
[10Mar2006-10:58:37] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> what idiots are wizards that are coding?
[10Mar2006-10:58:45] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Er um, nvm, too many examples
[10Mar2006-10:59:17] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'm going to write in a new add_action that simply checks to make sure the action is directed at that object/room
[10Mar2006-11:03:46] Cratylus <ds> ok, next release now includes a workaround for that board bug
[10Mar2006-12:27:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> When is the next version scheduled for a release?
[10Mar2006-12:27:40] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-12:28:10] Cratylus <ds> well i dunno i been flirting with the idea of doing it soon
[10Mar2006-12:28:44] Cratylus <ds> but i hate to release a bunch of compat busters only to do it again shortly after
[10Mar2006-12:29:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> we haven't even touched compat yet
[10Mar2006-12:36:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus, if you were going to improve intermud what feature set would you add in?
[10Mar2006-12:36:57] Cratylus <ds> can you give me an example of what you mean?
[10Mar2006-12:37:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> What would you change about intermud to make it more usable.  Not talking reliable here
[10Mar2006-12:37:49] Cratylus <ds> well
[10Mar2006-12:38:43] Cratylus <ds> if you mean the intermud subsystem on a mud, i've been meaning to implement intermud mail
[10Mar2006-12:38:53] Cratylus <ds> but it is a lot more complicated than it sounds
[10Mar2006-12:39:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> you might as well rewrite intermud
[10Mar2006-12:39:19] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> but why?
[10Mar2006-12:39:23] Cratylus <ds> nah actually theres intermud support for it, it's just a real pain in the ass
[10Mar2006-12:39:29] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> whats wrong with it?
[10Mar2006-12:40:07] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> I2 was flakey as hell (loved being able to do call_other on someone else's mud with a bad I2 implementation)
[10Mar2006-12:40:11] Cratylus <ds> dead souls doesnt have any intermud mail support at all, and no oob either, meaning i have to put all that shit together, and it's a lot of work for the payoff
[10Mar2006-12:40:18] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> but I3 seems alright.
[10Mar2006-12:40:28] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD nods
[10Mar2006-12:42:08] Cratylus <ds> plus, each mud sending/receiving mail has to either be dirently on the internet or have extra firewall ports opened
[10Mar2006-12:42:26] Cratylus <ds> so, it's a pain to implement. but it would be nice to have
[10Mar2006-12:42:46] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> oh mail is oob?  i guess that makes sense
[10Mar2006-12:42:52] Cratylus <ds> yeah
[10Mar2006-12:43:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> oob exits?
[10Mar2006-12:43:03] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD hasn't implemented mail yet either ;-)
[10Mar2006-12:43:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> lies
[10Mar2006-12:43:07] Cratylus <ds> its a good idea. tells kinda otta be too, if u aask me
[10Mar2006-12:43:35] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> oob = out of band?
[10Mar2006-12:43:41] Cratylus <ds> ya
[10Mar2006-12:43:43] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD is working on a mud mail with the ability to use normal smtp
[10Mar2006-12:43:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i've seen muds with it
[10Mar2006-12:44:19] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I think Everdark does an inbetween translation from the mail files to files the mud can read
[10Mar2006-12:44:21] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD is using exim+mysql+imap courier
[10Mar2006-12:44:43] Cratylus <ds> basically dead souls sends eve an auth request. eve sends back an id token. then dead souls connects directly to eve through the oob port, and sends an oob request. etc and so on, eventually my mail gets to your user via oob
[10Mar2006-12:45:23] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Crats, that just sounded liked chapter 3 of my Cryptography and security book
[10Mar2006-12:45:51] Cratylus <ds> which is inconvenient, but it's reasonable to want to avoid private mail floting about someone elses router
[10Mar2006-12:46:50] Cratylus <ds> ds didnt have auth support either until recently. i put it in as part of a keepalive
[10Mar2006-12:46:54] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> so why not just piggy back it on DS chan?
[10Mar2006-12:47:00] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-12:47:14] Cratylus <ds> i'd rather not *broadcast* private mail
[10Mar2006-12:47:16] <dead_souls> Ptah@Eve wasn't joking
[10Mar2006-12:48:06] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> You could tie it in to the @address for the chan, and only that place could read it... hrm, I suppose you could spoof that though
[10Mar2006-12:48:10] Cratylus <ds> i guess you could crypt it, but doing so is more complicated and impractical than just getting oob to work
[10Mar2006-12:48:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> do we really need intermud mail?
[10Mar2006-12:48:24] Cratylus <ds> no
[10Mar2006-12:48:26] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> nope
[10Mar2006-12:48:32] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> No.
[10Mar2006-12:48:40] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it is nice though
[10Mar2006-12:48:46] Cratylus <ds> yep
[10Mar2006-12:48:48] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I love how anything I have a potential solution for becomes "naw, nvm"
[10Mar2006-12:48:50] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> especially for creators needing help
[10Mar2006-12:48:56] <dead_souls> Ptah@Eve feels so useful!
[10Mar2006-12:49:06] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis comforts Ptah.
[10Mar2006-12:49:17] Cratylus <ds> ptah i'd gladly welcome your input on this
[10Mar2006-12:49:21] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Normal mail works fine and if players are asked to submit a working mail addy then I see no reason to have in-mud mail.
[10Mar2006-12:49:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Oh lord, youve done it now Cratylus
[10Mar2006-12:49:29] Cratylus <ds> this particular idea of using a channel just isn't workable
[10Mar2006-12:49:33] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> One of these days, I'll have an idea that will be revolutionary
[10Mar2006-12:49:59] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> In fact, till now I've only seen in-mud mails used for bug reports. And those can be sent to a normal mail box.
[10Mar2006-12:50:05] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Ptah, it just means that you've got ideas that are great but not applicable.  You're like a true *nix hacker.
[10Mar2006-12:50:19] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> well, in theory, everything is like a channel
[10Mar2006-12:50:23] Cratylus <ds> check out http://www.intermud.org/i3/specs/ for i3 specifications
[10Mar2006-12:50:27] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Ahson, heh
[10Mar2006-12:50:55] <dead_souls> Ptah@Eve ponders an email only channel
[10Mar2006-12:51:01] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> we used in-mud mail for tons of stuff besides bugs... we have a seperate system for bugs anyway
[10Mar2006-12:51:31] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Bah, here I am trying to re-invent the wheel, I am a *nix hacker
[10Mar2006-12:51:43] Cratylus <ds> take a look at how channels work. it makes privacy exceedingly difficult
[10Mar2006-12:51:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Eve has like 6 versions of the 'wheel'
[10Mar2006-12:52:23] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I'd just inherit the chan, encrypt, and deal with it that way in my high level type of hack attack solution
[10Mar2006-12:52:30] <dead_souls> Avatar@OuterSpace is currently on a mud where all wizards receive *all* intermud channels by default. (unless specifically turned off)
[10Mar2006-12:52:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I love being able to use ' here, but not in regular chat
[10Mar2006-12:53:16] Cratylus <ds> you could crypt it but in order for it to be decryptable to the recipient it has to be decryptable to everyone else too, unless you use keys
[10Mar2006-12:53:18] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD shudders... I think its time to work
[10Mar2006-12:53:24] Cratylus <ds> in which case we're talking oob again
[10Mar2006-12:54:02] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD wouldn't want to bog the driver down the encrypting/decrypting blowfish data or whatever anyway
[10Mar2006-12:54:04] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> heh, I should just run a freaking cron job to transfer regular pine email to a folder and have a mime reader in game then
[10Mar2006-12:54:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> forget reinventing email.  Just have pop3/smtp
[10Mar2006-12:54:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> oh wait, lets really do it OOG. Out of game. hmm
[10Mar2006-12:54:48] Cratylus <ds> that would be mighty cool
[10Mar2006-12:55:55] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> exim/mysql/courier ... exim writes out mail messages to individual files which are easy for a mud to read ;-)
[10Mar2006-12:56:07] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> exim you say?
[10Mar2006-12:56:09] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm
[10Mar2006-12:56:17] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Ok, good, someone thinks like I do then, I'm not insane
[10Mar2006-12:56:33] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> the mail would be totally seperate from the mud tho
[10Mar2006-12:56:37] <dead_souls> Brodbane@Eve no comment.
[10Mar2006-12:56:59] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> maybe that would be a nice addition to I3... a mud address to smtp address resolver
[10Mar2006-12:57:07] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> I think that's the best approach, trying to get pop3 or smtp services INSIDE of the mudos would be a pain in the butt
[10Mar2006-12:57:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yeah, just have a translated for sure
[10Mar2006-12:57:23] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> i.e. kriton@emerald.mud resolves to kriton@mud.gameworkshop.com
[10Mar2006-12:57:55] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> well... then we could use a channel for all those aliases to update that new service
[10Mar2006-12:58:01] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> a non vis channel
[10Mar2006-12:58:18] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> much like how dns updates work
[10Mar2006-12:58:24] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> just add a new service/packet type
[10Mar2006-12:58:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> you wouldn't need to use channels, just a translator daemon
[10Mar2006-12:58:42] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Let me fantasize about my overly complicated solutions!
[10Mar2006-12:58:48] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> smtp-resolve-q / smtp-resolve-q or whatever
[10Mar2006-13:01:04] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> Ptah, lets do email over ipv6 in game :)
[10Mar2006-13:01:49] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Heh, now you are talking my level of crazy complexity!
[10Mar2006-13:02:05] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ponders a 50k .c email object ingame
[10Mar2006-13:02:29] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> 50? Thats if I wrote it, you *nix guys will have 6-12 files totaling 1.5MB
[10Mar2006-13:02:35] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> says '3l1te' and then keels over and dies.
[10Mar2006-13:02:53] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD emotes too.
[10Mar2006-13:03:25] <dead_souls> Kriton@Emerald MUD writes it in 225 bytes of perl.
[10Mar2006-13:19:34] Cratylus <ds> remind me where the " ' " problem is happening?
[10Mar2006-13:19:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> standard speech
[10Mar2006-13:20:05] Cratylus <ds> heh ok
[10Mar2006-13:20:13] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> yes you lose that when you just use that char for say
[10Mar2006-13:20:17] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> like in dont
[10Mar2006-13:21:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I dont speak english on Dead Souls, so i cant talk
[10Mar2006-13:21:43] Cratylus <ds> heh yeah thats a feature
[10Mar2006-13:22:17] Cratylus <ds> call me->SetLanguage("English",100)
[10Mar2006-13:25:10] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> sigh... where is the lpc manual online at?
[10Mar2006-13:32:27] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> which one?
[10Mar2006-13:32:39] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Hes all set, i believe
[10Mar2006-13:32:51] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> sweet.
[10Mar2006-13:32:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Neg, I am Ptah, Set is another god
[10Mar2006-13:32:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Sometimes we are on the same mud, other times he pretends to not know me
[10Mar2006-14:07:52] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Hrm... sscanf will not properly convert a negative number eh?
[10Mar2006-14:08:14] Cratylus <ds> what's the syntax yer using?
[10Mar2006-14:08:26] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> sscanf(str,"%d",aln)
[10Mar2006-14:08:48] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> %-d?
[10Mar2006-14:08:48] Cratylus <ds> i presum aln is an int
[10Mar2006-14:09:06] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> It's numeric yeah
[10Mar2006-14:09:14] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> 100 works fine, -100 doesnt
[10Mar2006-14:09:16] Cratylus <ds> is it a float or an int?
[10Mar2006-14:09:22] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> float
[10Mar2006-14:09:32] Cratylus <ds> see what happens with an int
[10Mar2006-14:09:48] Cratylus <ds> i bet it works. with a float you might try a different token, lemme doublecheck
[10Mar2006-14:09:56] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> %f?
[10Mar2006-14:11:07] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> int doesnt work either
[10Mar2006-14:11:29] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> It just doesn't like negs
[10Mar2006-14:11:51] Kriton@Emerald MUD <dead_souls> it should
[10Mar2006-14:11:59] Cratylus <ds> yeah this doesnt sound right
[10Mar2006-14:12:37] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> nvm, I am a tard
[10Mar2006-14:15:24] Cratylus <ds> yeah it's working fine for me
[10Mar2006-14:16:24] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> hrm... does k=0 + -1000 work?
[10Mar2006-14:16:53] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> heh
[10Mar2006-14:17:11] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> are you getting 1 as output?
[10Mar2006-14:17:15] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> yes
[10Mar2006-14:17:27] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> this is because thats effectively a modal
[10Mar2006-14:17:43] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> so that's the problem...
[10Mar2006-14:17:45] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> you need something like k = (0 + -1000)
[10Mar2006-14:18:15] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> force it to resolve before it interprets eh?
[10Mar2006-14:18:35] Cratylus@Frontiers <dead_souls> otherwise you're evaluating whether the arithmetic occurred, not the value of the arithmetic
[10Mar2006-14:19:55] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> ok, then what about k=-1000 - 0?
[10Mar2006-14:20:12] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> er I mean k=(-1000 - 0)
[10Mar2006-14:20:22] Cratylus <ds> what about it?
[10Mar2006-14:20:30] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> well, it's still giving a 1
[10Mar2006-14:21:14] Cratylus <ds> let me test that
[10Mar2006-14:22:52] Cratylus <ds> you're doing something wrong
[10Mar2006-14:22:56] Cratylus <ds> i'm not getthing that
[10Mar2006-14:23:20] Cratylus <ds> can you show me the line doing this calculation?
[10Mar2006-14:23:27] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> well, it's in reality k=(p - j) where p=-1000 and j=0
[10Mar2006-14:24:59] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Hrm... bugger
[10Mar2006-14:25:33] Cratylus <ds> nope.
[10Mar2006-14:25:41] Cratylus <ds> i'm not replicating your result
[10Mar2006-14:25:53] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> Ok, this conditional is being odd with those values if(j > p && p < 0 && j = 0)
[10Mar2006-14:26:11] Ptah@Eve <dead_souls> and I just noticed its = not ==
[10Mar2006-14:26:11] Cratylus <ds> well there ya go
[10Mar2006-14:27:36] Cratylus <ds> in my tests so far, btw, k=-1000 - 0 is the same as k = (-1000 - 0)
[10Mar2006-14:27:54] Cratylus <ds> so it isnt actually modal as i'd first thought
[10Mar2006-14:28:40] Cratylus <ds> though my variables are so cryptic and easy to confuse as the ones yer using
[10Mar2006-16:51:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> debugger question, I've got some code that is not kicking up any kind of useful debug info.  no logs, and dbxwhere/frame just tell me that it's crashing during the update.c call
[10Mar2006-16:52:27] Cratylus <ds> filename?
[10Mar2006-16:52:33] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> I am not quite sure how to track down the error from there.
[10Mar2006-16:52:59] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> itembackground.c in /props
[10Mar2006-16:53:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> ;)
[10Mar2006-16:53:14] Cratylus <ds> elog lib doesnt help?
[10Mar2006-16:53:19] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> elog lib
[10Mar2006-16:54:08] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> huh, thought that I'd already checked the lib log.
[10Mar2006-19:50:16] Cratylus <ds> hi tao. you can use this line for questions n stuff
[10Mar2006-19:50:32] Cratylus <ds> it's shared between dead souls muds
[10Mar2006-19:50:32] Tao@Dead_Souls_tao <dead_souls> thanks
[10Mar2006-19:50:40] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Woohoo new admin
[10Mar2006-19:50:54] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> great, now i have someone to help me :)
[10Mar2006-19:51:02] Tao@Dead_Souls_tao <dead_souls> i have never tried anything like this before..and am just finding my feet
[10Mar2006-19:51:12] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Your amoung friends tao
[10Mar2006-19:51:20] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> im only 2 days old :)
[10Mar2006-19:51:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hehe, i've got 200 days of logged mud time
[10Mar2006-19:51:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i have no life
[10Mar2006-19:52:11] Tao@Dead_Souls_tao <dead_souls> is there anything i should know..like if my mistakes can affect anyone else's machine etc?
[10Mar2006-19:52:25] Tao@Dead_Souls_tao <dead_souls> i am a complete newbie at this :D
[10Mar2006-19:52:25] Cratylus <ds> nothing you do will affect us unless you start spamming this line
[10Mar2006-19:52:59] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Hey cratylus, i can modify the mudlib right?
[10Mar2006-19:53:07] Cratylus <ds> it's yours to do what you want with
[10Mar2006-19:53:17] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Yay
[10Mar2006-19:53:21] Tao@Dead_Souls_tao <dead_souls> cool, :D
[10Mar2006-19:53:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> to bad i have no clue where to start :(
[10Mar2006-19:53:33] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> lol, ya got the source bud, do whatever you want :p
[10Mar2006-19:53:45] Cratylus <ds> start by reading the players handbook
[10Mar2006-19:53:49] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> My suggestion would be to read a lot of the stuff that he's put together
[10Mar2006-19:53:55] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> I never got past chapter 3 in C++, For Dummies
[10Mar2006-19:54:07] Cratylus <ds> also read all the faqs on the mud homepage
[10Mar2006-19:54:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> oh no, i know lpc and such up the wazoo
[10Mar2006-19:54:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> its stuff like changing the command 'score' that i want to do, but have no clue
[10Mar2006-19:55:01] Cratylus <ds> practice and experience. but you know that, i'm sure
[10Mar2006-19:55:16] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> which is a wonderful command that I learned about on here the other day :p
[10Mar2006-19:55:22] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i also want to make quests completely optional as well, not required to level up
[10Mar2006-19:55:34] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> although i could just change dirk to get rid of the qp requirement
[10Mar2006-19:56:14] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> wink wink
[10Mar2006-19:56:14] Cratylus <ds> i added the quest requirement cuz i figured it was easier to remove than to implement from scratch for new people
[10Mar2006-19:56:34] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Sorry, im a bit of a newb, as well as a n00b, at this stuff
[10Mar2006-19:56:56] Cratylus <ds> however, you could just not use dirk and use some other method of advancement
[10Mar2006-19:57:16] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Eh, here's another thing to try, look at the other items and such to get an idea how to do things
[10Mar2006-19:57:28] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> true, i like dirk, and its easy to modify to allow no qp for level
[10Mar2006-19:57:42] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Crat, you were talkin about vim, what was the thing you were sayin about it and going to the end brace or whatnot?
[10Mar2006-19:57:58] Cratylus <ds> highlight a brace, pracket or parenthesis
[10Mar2006-19:58:02] Cratylus <ds> then type: %
[10Mar2006-19:58:12] Cratylus <ds> you jump to that thing's partner
[10Mar2006-19:58:36] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> brb guys
[10Mar2006-19:58:45] Cratylus <ds> k
[10Mar2006-19:58:49] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Interesting, I think I'll have to print out a cheatsheet then try it again
[10Mar2006-20:00:31] Cratylus <ds> $ puts you at the end of a line. ^ puts you at the start. ctrl-g tells you where you are
[10Mar2006-20:01:07] Cratylus <ds> dd deletes a line. yyp copies the line above. o adds a line below. O adds a line above
[10Mar2006-20:01:27] Cratylus <ds> those are the ones i use most, aside from the obvious a i x
[10Mar2006-20:01:45] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ya
[10Mar2006-20:02:07] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> okay, could someone help me understand the score.c file?
[10Mar2006-20:02:18] Cratylus <ds> what do you need to know?
[10Mar2006-20:02:38] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> umm, lots of this stuff
[10Mar2006-20:02:46] Cratylus <ds> that's a little vague
[10Mar2006-20:02:58] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> what do you want to do first of all
[10Mar2006-20:02:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Give him a line number
[10Mar2006-20:03:02] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> like 1-ALL OF THEM
[10Mar2006-20:03:04] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> like i said, i never did get into c++ much, so alot of this is unfamiliar to me
[10Mar2006-20:03:14] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> yeah, what brodbane said
[10Mar2006-20:03:28] Cratylus <ds> you should probably read the creators manual
[10Mar2006-20:03:34] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> no, Oriam, I think that was to you.
[10Mar2006-20:03:40] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> first of all, like this
[10Mar2006-20:03:42] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> (string)this_player()->GetReligion()
[10Mar2006-20:03:46] Cratylus <ds> even though you may know a lot of it, a reviw will help
[10Mar2006-20:03:50] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> where can i find a list of these commands
[10Mar2006-20:04:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I can explain some Oriam
[10Mar2006-20:04:02] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> functions rather, you know what i mean
[10Mar2006-20:04:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You are a player, and an object
[10Mar2006-20:04:26] Cratylus <ds> there are too many to list. those are functions, and the way to understand them is to know what types of functions look like what and what they do
[10Mar2006-20:04:30] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i know
[10Mar2006-20:04:44] Cratylus <ds> take a look at /doc/efun
[10Mar2006-20:04:46] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i mean, is there a list i can find in the mudlib?
[10Mar2006-20:05:02] Cratylus <ds> there are too many functions to list the way you mean
[10Mar2006-20:05:17] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> how about some of the common ones
[10Mar2006-20:05:23] Cratylus <ds> the most important ones ar emostly documented in /doc/sefun and /doc/efun
[10Mar2006-20:05:33] Cratylus <ds> you can look there
[10Mar2006-20:05:35] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> kay, ill look through em
[10Mar2006-20:06:03] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i dont suppose that there are more files available for example on the web are there?
[10Mar2006-20:06:15] Cratylus <ds> what you see is what you get
[10Mar2006-20:06:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus stuck a gold mine in here
[10Mar2006-20:06:27] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> There are a few, but they're mostly for other libs
[10Mar2006-20:06:27] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> yeah
[10Mar2006-20:06:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i just like to see lots of examples
[10Mar2006-20:06:43] Cratylus <ds> /domains/town
[10Mar2006-20:06:47] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i do have to say by far this is my favorit mudlib
[10Mar2006-20:06:53] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Instead of trying to understand components of the lib, try actually making a few rooms/npcs/objects
[10Mar2006-20:07:01] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> that do things, like move, create other objects
[10Mar2006-20:07:07] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ive done that, ive made an entire wiz palace
[10Mar2006-20:07:19] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Cratylus, how far off is this from NM 3?
[10Mar2006-20:07:23] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hrmm, create other objects, intresting
[10Mar2006-20:07:33] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Oriam, can you interact with your npc's and objects?
[10Mar2006-20:07:43] Cratylus <ds> i would especially recommend reading http://dead-souls.net/example.html
[10Mar2006-20:07:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Try making a 'remote' without looking at Crat's remote code
[10Mar2006-20:08:05] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> not really, but based on my interpretation of dirk, i can make it respnd to simple things.
[10Mar2006-20:08:19] Cratylus <ds> jerin, this is to nm3 like german is to english
[10Mar2006-20:08:32] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> lol, k
[10Mar2006-20:08:36] Cratylus <ds> not exaclty mutually intelligible, but very very similar
[10Mar2006-20:08:58] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ya, I thought I read somewhere that they were close or some hoopla like that
[10Mar2006-20:09:28] Cratylus <ds> dead souls 1 is basically the last iteration of nightmare IV, which was a leap forward from nm3
[10Mar2006-20:09:48] Cratylus <ds> http://dead-souls.net/ds-faq.html
[10Mar2006-20:10:38] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ahh, ya, sorry, musta been half asleep when I read that the first time
[10Mar2006-20:12:39] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i took a brief look at crats remote contol and that thing is way to complicated
[10Mar2006-20:13:07] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Then keep on workin on an area til it isn't complicated :p
[10Mar2006-20:13:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> lol
[10Mar2006-20:13:35] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> The remote can be used to make pets, players LOVE pets
[10Mar2006-20:13:45] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> well, its the basis for pet code
[10Mar2006-20:13:45] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> okay, before i do that, i need to know something
[10Mar2006-20:14:29] Cratylus <ds> the secret to the remote control isnt the device itself, it's the drone shadow that it creates
[10Mar2006-20:14:45] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> how do i make quests. im a bit confused on that
[10Mar2006-20:14:53] Cratylus <ds> that's in the advanced lpc text descartes never got around to writing
[10Mar2006-20:15:01] Cratylus <ds> ah quests
[10Mar2006-20:15:11] Cratylus <ds> anything can be a quest
[10Mar2006-20:15:34] Cratylus <ds> if you code an object to do so, just picking it up can give you quest points and a quest title
[10Mar2006-20:15:36] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so, basically i make an npc
[10Mar2006-20:15:46] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> and its like hey, go get <insert thing here>
[10Mar2006-20:15:48] Cratylus <ds> take a look at /domains/town/npc/leo for guidance
[10Mar2006-20:15:56] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> then you get and and come back, and it gives you qp?
[10Mar2006-20:16:14] Cratylus <ds> quest it whatever you make it. it can be as boring as what you just said
[10Mar2006-20:16:24] Cratylus <ds> or it can be deeply complex and metaphysical
[10Mar2006-20:16:26] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> lol
[10Mar2006-20:16:42] Cratylus <ds> in the end what matters is you coding a mechanism for an object giving a player quest points and a quest title
[10Mar2006-20:16:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> You know, my first pet commander object thing didnt use shadows
[10Mar2006-20:17:34] Cratylus <ds> mine didnt either. the first generation of the control did this ghastly thing where the original npc was destroyed and a subservient duplicate put in its place
[10Mar2006-20:17:48] Cratylus <ds> it worked, but it was inelegant
[10Mar2006-20:18:29] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ah, i had mine spawn a 'familiar' if the player rubbed an idol shaped like the animal
[10Mar2006-20:18:39] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> so i didn't have to commandeer the npc
[10Mar2006-20:19:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> is there a command i can use to show me where an npc exists?
[10Mar2006-20:19:57] Cratylus <ds> the question makes assumptions that are not valid
[10Mar2006-20:20:13] Cratylus <ds> but, generally speaking, try findobj dirk
[10Mar2006-20:20:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> kay
[10Mar2006-20:21:15] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hrmm, it seems leo is nonexistant
[10Mar2006-20:21:23] Cratylus <ds> that's the part with invalid assumptions
[10Mar2006-20:21:42] Cratylus <ds> no objects are "existing" until they are loaded onto memory
[10Mar2006-20:22:06] Cratylus <ds> so until someone walks into leo's room and thereby loads his file, there is no leo on the mud
[10Mar2006-20:22:06] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i mean i need to the room in which a npc exists
[10Mar2006-20:22:24] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hrmm, then why does it show leo and i havent visited him yet?
[10Mar2006-20:22:34] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ahh nvm
[10Mar2006-20:22:42] Cratylus <ds> is there a number after leo's filename?
[10Mar2006-20:22:44] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> one of the guys on my mud ran through his room
[10Mar2006-20:22:52] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> nope
[10Mar2006-20:23:18] Cratylus <ds> that's the master copy of leo. it doesnt actually exist anywhere
[10Mar2006-20:23:32] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i see
[10Mar2006-20:24:31] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> so could i clone leo anywhere and he work properly?
[10Mar2006-20:24:51] Cratylus <ds> not quite
[10Mar2006-20:25:15] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> where is leo located?
[10Mar2006-20:25:17] Cratylus <ds> well, ok the short answer is yes, with a complicated exception
[10Mar2006-20:25:33] Cratylus <ds> /domains/town/npc/leo.c
[10Mar2006-20:25:41] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i mean roomwise
[10Mar2006-20:25:41] Cratylus <ds> /domains/town/room/basement.c
[10Mar2006-20:26:03] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> howd you find that? memory?
[10Mar2006-20:26:13] Cratylus <ds> heh no, i coded him. i know where he lives
[10Mar2006-20:26:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> thats what i mean
[10Mar2006-20:27:40] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> how do i ask leo bout quests
[10Mar2006-20:27:56] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i dont see anything in the code that would seem to allow him to interact with me
[10Mar2006-20:28:14] Cratylus <ds> hmmm
[10Mar2006-20:28:26] Cratylus <ds> can you tell me what you exected to see?
[10Mar2006-20:28:38] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hes muttering about the orcslayer
[10Mar2006-20:29:10] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> in the code, it says if you have completed the orcslayer quest, then it will tell you. how do i get it to display that message
[10Mar2006-20:29:46] Cratylus <ds> you're confusing me. isn't the messagein the code you're reading?
[10Mar2006-20:30:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> this_player()->eventPrint("blah")
[10Mar2006-20:30:12] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> blargh
[10Mar2006-20:30:31] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> or write()
[10Mar2006-20:30:41] Cratylus <ds> i dont think that's what he's asking
[10Mar2006-20:30:57] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> okay, hes muttering about the orcslayer. is there anyway to get him to say more about it, or do i have to solve the rest on my own?
[10Mar2006-20:31:13] Cratylus <ds> what you see is what you get
[10Mar2006-20:31:15] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> oh hes your npc Crat, yeah,hmm
[10Mar2006-20:31:23] Cratylus <ds> i strongly urge you to read the players handbook
[10Mar2006-20:31:25] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> well aint that a barrel of fun
[10Mar2006-20:31:27] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i ahve
[10Mar2006-20:31:37] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> have*
[10Mar2006-20:31:45] Cratylus <ds> i want to help you, but i cant just make you understand code over a channel
[10Mar2006-20:32:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Crat, if you have two muds on intermud with the same name, who wins?
[10Mar2006-20:32:07] Cratylus <ds> the orcslayer quest is explained in detail in the handbook
[10Mar2006-20:32:13] Cratylus <ds> the first one to boot
[10Mar2006-20:42:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> testing
[10Mar2006-20:42:12] Cratylus <ds> passed
[10Mar2006-20:42:18] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> loud and clear
[10Mar2006-20:42:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok
[10Mar2006-20:42:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> afk, must perform fatherly obligations
[10Mar2006-20:57:01] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> aight, im off to work on my server comp
[10Mar2006-20:57:04] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> later guys
[10Mar2006-20:57:09] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> and thanks for the help
[10Mar2006-21:02:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Man, i wish i developed on a nightmare mud previous, everything is not where i'm expecting it
[10Mar2006-21:03:00] Cratylus <ds> by oriam
[10Mar2006-21:03:23] Cratylus <ds> brodbane, yeah there were lots of changes between nm3 and nm IV
[10Mar2006-21:09:16] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> /lib/guild.c is faulty
[10Mar2006-21:09:24] Cratylus <ds> is it ever
[10Mar2006-21:10:04] Cratylus <ds> its pretty much totally fuxt. guilds will probably look very different by the time i'm done
[10Mar2006-21:10:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Ok, so i change GenerateObviousExits(), and then a update /lib/* and /lib/std/*, and -r of course and still no propogation
[10Mar2006-21:11:30] Cratylus <ds> whatever room oyu want to have the new functionality: update -r /path/to/room.c
[10Mar2006-21:12:39] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> It helps when i'm in a room that isn't circumventing my change by calling it itself
[10Mar2006-21:12:39] Cratylus <ds> rooms not yet loaded will then have the functionality when you do load them
[10Mar2006-21:32:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> doesnt inherit LIB_OBJECT give you object::init access?
[10Mar2006-21:32:51] Cratylus <ds> no
[10Mar2006-21:33:03] Cratylus <ds> erm wait iread that wrong
[10Mar2006-21:33:11] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i've got an object
[10Mar2006-21:33:19] Cratylus <ds> object::init();
[10Mar2006-21:33:51] Cratylus <ds> unless theres good reason for it, that should be the first line in the init() fun of the object
[10Mar2006-21:34:07] Cratylus <ds> unless theres good reason for doing otherwise, that should be the first line in the init() fun of the object
[10Mar2006-21:34:15] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> /open/Brodbane/poolTable.c line 181: No such inherited function object::init
[10Mar2006-21:34:23] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thats in my init() for the object
[10Mar2006-21:34:37] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> oh btw, thats a working poolTable:)
[10Mar2006-21:44:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> what an utterly disgusting amount of math
[10Mar2006-21:44:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> vectors, collisions
[10Mar2006-21:44:50] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Better you then me :p
[10Mar2006-22:28:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm TEAL isn't an available ansi color
[10Mar2006-22:29:38] Cratylus <ds> colors
[10Mar2006-22:33:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm, can you or them together to get a lighter... say blue?
[10Mar2006-22:33:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> or them together*
[10Mar2006-22:36:24] Cratylus <ds> BOLD
[10Mar2006-22:36:36] Cratylus <ds> grep for BOLD in /lib/*
[10Mar2006-22:36:50] Cratylus <ds> grep BOLD /lib/*
[10Mar2006-22:37:00] Cratylus <ds> oh heh that wont work will it
[10Mar2006-22:37:08] Cratylus <ds> hang on
[10Mar2006-22:37:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> holy crap, i love grep!
[10Mar2006-22:37:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> the source looks like a light bright, but i like it
[10Mar2006-22:37:50] Cratylus <ds> ya anyway look for examples of color use in lib
[10Mar2006-22:38:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> My old mud had a teal, but i just cant locate it
[10Mar2006-22:38:17] Cratylus <ds> what does teal look like?
[10Mar2006-22:38:43] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> thats regular cyan, isnt it?
[10Mar2006-22:38:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> nah, cyan is very bright
[10Mar2006-22:38:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> its a dull cyan
[10Mar2006-22:38:57] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> no, thats bold cyan
[10Mar2006-22:39:07] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> regular cyan isnt bright, bold cyan is
[10Mar2006-22:39:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Teal is a yellowish green
[10Mar2006-22:39:21] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> teal is a blueish green isnt it?
[10Mar2006-22:39:25] Cratylus <ds> sounds like a bunch of goddamn interior decorators in here
[10Mar2006-22:39:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> teal is blueish green
[10Mar2006-22:39:35] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Brod, you wrote a pool table in lpc?
[10Mar2006-22:39:41] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> then thats regular cyan
[10Mar2006-22:39:49] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Not my pool table, its another guy's
[10Mar2006-22:40:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> when i do 'colors' the cyan i see is offensive
[10Mar2006-22:40:15] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> :http://noz.day-break.net/webcolor/teal.html
[10Mar2006-22:40:47] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> dont go by that
[10Mar2006-22:41:01] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> 006666
[10Mar2006-22:41:05] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> that one
[10Mar2006-22:41:16] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> regular cyan
[10Mar2006-22:41:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> +points to Kirstus
[10Mar2006-22:41:54] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> eval return write("%^CYAN%^test%^RESET%^")
[10Mar2006-22:41:56] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> side note, the 'colors' command needs to reflect the actual color of cyan
[10Mar2006-22:42:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> thats more blue then 006666
[10Mar2006-22:42:40] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> thats pretty damn close
[10Mar2006-22:42:58] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> given the few choices, that must be it
[10Mar2006-22:45:43] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Crat can I make a suggestion on the clone cmd?  If the obj you are trying to clone isn't in the directory, it should output something a little more helpful, then: Failed to clone file: blah
[10Mar2006-22:45:57] Cratylus <ds> for example?
[10Mar2006-22:46:07] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> It should read your mind
[10Mar2006-22:46:19] Cratylus <ds> right. clone what i meant not what i typed
[10Mar2006-22:46:29] Cratylus <ds> the parser isnt there yet
[10Mar2006-22:46:39] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> it should say something like: Failed to clone: file not in current directory.
[10Mar2006-22:46:41] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> my VB.NET mudlib so assumes what i meant
[10Mar2006-22:46:55] Cratylus <ds> well why dont you marry it, then?
[10Mar2006-22:46:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> poking fun at me?
[10Mar2006-22:47:03] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> no, at Ptah
[10Mar2006-22:47:25] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> okay, b/c my other project is a vb.net mud too.
[10Mar2006-22:47:46] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hehe, I didn't know that.  Sometimes i forget their may be other VB programmers in the room
[10Mar2006-22:47:52] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> their = there
[10Mar2006-22:48:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> There are only a few conditions for the standard "failed to clone file:" message
[10Mar2006-22:48:44] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> if they aren't prefixed with compile errors, its a directory issue
[10Mar2006-22:48:54] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> compile = runtime
[10Mar2006-22:49:36] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods in understanding.
[10Mar2006-22:51:55] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Anyone know of a function that converts ints to string representation? I think I had to write one last time
[10Mar2006-22:52:11] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ie 1 = one
[10Mar2006-22:52:33] Cratylus <ds> itoa()
[10Mar2006-22:52:37] Cratylus <ds> on
[10Mar2006-22:52:41] Cratylus <ds> oh
[10Mar2006-22:52:55] Cratylus <ds> cardinal
[10Mar2006-22:52:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> yeah a little more tricky
[10Mar2006-22:53:11] Cratylus <ds> cardinal(42)
[10Mar2006-22:53:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> cardinal(42) == "Forty Two"?
[10Mar2006-22:53:48] Cratylus <ds> eval return cardinal(42)
[10Mar2006-22:54:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> excellent
[10Mar2006-22:55:55] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> billion is as high as it goes?
[10Mar2006-22:56:10] Cratylus <ds> heh
[10Mar2006-22:56:22] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> It can't handle over a billion? I'm so going to rewrite mudos
[10Mar2006-22:56:58] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> damn right.  Teach mudos a lesson!
[10Mar2006-22:57:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> eval return cardinal(999999999), i can't imagine how they did it
[10Mar2006-22:58:02] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> wow.
[10Mar2006-23:05:13] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> bug: down doesn't alias to d
[10Mar2006-23:05:25] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ie, 'down' gets you no where
[10Mar2006-23:06:21] Kristus@The Hollow <dead_souls> sure it does
[10Mar2006-23:06:23] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> VICTORY!
[10Mar2006-23:06:27] Cratylus <ds> neither does east
[10Mar2006-23:06:33] Cratylus <ds> "go down", "go east"
[10Mar2006-23:08:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hrmm, you got me there
[10Mar2006-23:10:46] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> DS accepts !=NULL as an evaluation for an if statement, yes?
[10Mar2006-23:12:25] Cratylus <ds> i've never tried it, i'd be surprised if it did
[10Mar2006-23:12:47] Cratylus <ds> if(!thing)
[10Mar2006-23:12:53] Cratylus <ds> if(thing == "")
[10Mar2006-23:13:49] Cratylus <ds> obviously the opposites are if(thing), if(thing != "")
[10Mar2006-23:14:27] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods.
[10Mar2006-23:35:18] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Where can I find what is compiled in?
[10Mar2006-23:35:49] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> sweet, now I can add properties to items and verbs with the speed of my typing.
[10Mar2006-23:36:03] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> Jerin, waddya mean compiled in?
[10Mar2006-23:36:51] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I was looking at pow in /doc/efun/floats and it said if PACKAGE_MATH is compiled in
[10Mar2006-23:37:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hmm.  eventDescribeEnvironment and look do not contain the line that prints out the path of the room you are in
[10Mar2006-23:38:23] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> they were talking about floats earlier, I'm pretty sure it's part of the distro
[10Mar2006-23:38:35] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> we have floats
[10Mar2006-23:38:50] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I assumed as much
[10Mar2006-23:39:26] Cratylus <ds> ds2.0r14/v22.2b14/local_options
[10Mar2006-23:39:36] Cratylus <ds> ds2.0r14/v22.2b14/options.h
[10Mar2006-23:39:40] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> eval return 1.45+2.5
[10Mar2006-23:40:32] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> eval return 1.544+2
[10Mar2006-23:41:10] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> cool, thank ya much
[10Mar2006-23:41:20] Cratylus <ds> eval return 21.99/7.0
[10Mar2006-23:41:32] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> or eval return pow( 2, 4 )
[10Mar2006-23:41:58] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> that's the one I was specifically lookin at
[10Mar2006-23:42:04] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Cratylus, where the hell is the path being printed when 'look' is called
[10Mar2006-23:42:23] Cratylus <ds> players don't see that. only creators
[10Mar2006-23:42:27] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> right
[10Mar2006-23:42:57] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> I've checked out look and eventDescribeEnvironment expecting to find an if(creatorp())
[10Mar2006-23:50:43] Cratylus <ds> /lib/creator line 105
[10Mar2006-23:51:47] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ahhh, thanks
[10Mar2006-23:53:06] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> god, we'd all be lost if cratylus wasn't around as much as he is, wouldn't we?
[10Mar2006-23:53:18] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'd just waste a lot more time
[10Mar2006-23:53:34] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis guffaws.
[11Mar2006-00:33:57] Cratylus <ds> heh. locates are for people on the intermud
[11Mar2006-00:34:17] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> lol
[11Mar2006-00:34:23] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Whoops :p
[11Mar2006-00:34:31] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Sorry bout that
[11Mar2006-00:35:01] Cratylus <ds> header files are usually in /include or /secure/include
[11Mar2006-00:35:01] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> 'spose I should read the help file before I type a new command then
[11Mar2006-00:35:15] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ya, that was my next spot to check
[11Mar2006-01:08:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Is there a function that will convert an int to a time format?  ie, 123 = 2m3s?
[11Mar2006-01:08:46] Cratylus <ds> nope
[11Mar2006-01:13:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> you know, you should have a convert_age() in time.c, so if a player sends you a tell and you are idle they get some indication back
[11Mar2006-01:13:56] Cratylus <ds> idle cratylus
[11Mar2006-01:14:04] Cratylus <ds> also rwho dead souls
[11Mar2006-01:14:42] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ah, that works too
[11Mar2006-01:20:08] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> what function are you using to convert query_idle into that nice string?
[11Mar2006-01:20:30] Cratylus <ds> dunno. what's it look like?
[11Mar2006-01:21:04] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> Recluse has been idle for eighteen minutes and seventeen seconds.
[11Mar2006-01:21:20] Cratylus <ds> heh
[11Mar2006-01:21:30] Cratylus <ds> which idle
[11Mar2006-01:21:38] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> 'idle'
[11Mar2006-01:21:42] Cratylus <ds> more /cmds/players/idle.c
[11Mar2006-01:22:23] Cratylus <ds> that will show you where the command is, and what it contains
[11Mar2006-01:24:33] Cratylus <ds> and yes i'm the lib maintainer :)
[11Mar2006-01:24:39] Cratylus <ds> damn. mischan
[11Mar2006-01:26:24] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hehe
[11Mar2006-01:35:21] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> ok, done with the who command now
[11Mar2006-01:35:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> it now reports idleness, if people are tell blocking, if people are in ed
[11Mar2006-01:35:53] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> the works
[11Mar2006-01:40:18] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Now just a hypothetical, if people reworked commands, would you make something such as a snippets page?
[11Mar2006-01:42:53] Cratylus <ds> mmhmmm...?
[11Mar2006-01:42:59] Cratylus <ds> oh
[11Mar2006-01:43:07] Cratylus <ds> well sure i can do that
[11Mar2006-01:43:19] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> I doubt it'd happen, but just asking in general
[11Mar2006-01:43:43] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Like for myself, I'm trying to create a blank command that I can refer to later on when and if I want to
[11Mar2006-01:44:09] Cratylus <ds> take a look in cmds/ in your homedir
[11Mar2006-01:44:17] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Yup, doin that now
[11Mar2006-01:45:10] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> k, after adding in a so-called command, what else do I need to do?
[11Mar2006-01:45:42] Cratylus <ds> update /daemon/command
[11Mar2006-01:46:06] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Awesome, thanks
[11Mar2006-01:46:12] Cratylus <ds> no prob
[11Mar2006-01:54:20] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i'd have no problem sharing any or all of Eve's modifications
[11Mar2006-02:03:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> the problem becomes maintaining all the inheritance schemes, and all that stuff to do snippets.  I think that is one of the biggest reasons that LP is not as popular (other then those talked about yesterday)
[11Mar2006-02:04:11] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> IRT: sharing lib mods.
[11Mar2006-02:04:15] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Well, if they were generic enough
[11Mar2006-02:05:51] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> some are, some aren't
[11Mar2006-02:05:58] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> It would become a headache to maintain.  Just getting upgrades out from the core development lib is going to cause headaches.
[11Mar2006-02:06:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> commands are fairly abstract enough
[11Mar2006-02:06:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> sure but they have to be applicable too.
[11Mar2006-02:07:00] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Well just being able to see the thought processes of other people though, they may be able to modify it to suit their needs or make something that accomplishes the same
[11Mar2006-03:44:29] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> anyone on who knows where the save function is?  preferably the player/soul one?
[11Mar2006-10:09:22] Cratylus <ds> yer prolly looking for one of the functions in /doc/efun/general
[11Mar2006-11:16:07] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> yah, I was actually looking for the code.
[11Mar2006-11:33:04] Cratylus <ds> unfortunately that's in the guts of the driver
[11Mar2006-11:41:28] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis throws his hands up in disgust.
[11Mar2006-11:42:20] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> that's allright, I shuffled my todo list last night, b/c I realized that that wasn't what I wanted to do next.  I want to do Dynamic Descriptions next!
[11Mar2006-12:30:23] Cratylus <ds> i can't think of any way to save/manipulate files without efuns...some stuff just belongs in the driver
[11Mar2006-12:30:49] Cratylus <ds> if it's i/o, you want it happening as fast and efficiently as possible to avoid lag
[11Mar2006-12:34:20] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis nods.
[11Mar2006-13:17:25] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> hist
[11Mar2006-13:26:08] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> -erectomy!
[11Mar2006-13:26:40] <dead_souls> Ashon@Stargate Atlantis fails to chuckle at his own joke.
[11Mar2006-14:28:33] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> quiet here today
[11Mar2006-14:34:45] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Yup
[11Mar2006-14:35:17] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> On three different muds I play/work on the player numbers are low
[11Mar2006-14:42:39] Cratylus <ds> intermud went down
[11Mar2006-14:42:47] Cratylus <ds> just came back up a few minutes ago
[11Mar2006-14:45:12] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i hate a great time with the 9mm pistol last night
[11Mar2006-14:45:20] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> little saddened by its reload bug
[11Mar2006-14:45:30] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> i had*
[11Mar2006-14:45:36] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> man i cant type as of late
[11Mar2006-14:48:09] Cratylus <ds> havent played with the pistol in a while
[11Mar2006-14:48:27] Cratylus <ds> its part of a ranged weapon project thats dormant for now
[11Mar2006-15:04:54] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> it wont be used in our mud
[11Mar2006-15:05:00] Brodbane@Eve <dead_souls> just a fun pulp fiction distraction
[11Mar2006-16:57:02] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Is it possible to change descriptions for races so they don't just reflect the number and types of limbs they have?  For RP and such?
[11Mar2006-16:57:48] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> no idea but i like the sound of it :)
[11Mar2006-16:59:24] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> Can you remember which way round the SetMelee flag gose is it 1 for does normally use weapon of 0 for dose normally use weapon?
[11Mar2006-17:00:25] Cratylus <ds> melee is non weapon
[11Mar2006-17:00:49] Cratylus <ds> melee 1 makes the thing good at unarmed combat
[11Mar2006-17:01:23] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> ahh so my rabbit should be melee 1 then
[11Mar2006-17:01:25] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Where are the race descriptions and such autogenerated from?
[11Mar2006-17:01:29] Cratylus <ds> as to race descriptions, sure. you can put descriptions in /doc/help
[11Mar2006-17:01:45] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> thanx cratylus
[11Mar2006-17:01:49] Cratylus <ds> np
[11Mar2006-17:01:51] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Ah.
[11Mar2006-17:03:20] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> I'm not sure, where do the extant race help files come from?
[11Mar2006-17:03:26] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> I can't see them in /doc/help/races
[11Mar2006-17:03:46] Cratylus <ds> nope theyre not there
[11Mar2006-17:03:52] Cratylus <ds> oh thats not files
[11Mar2006-17:04:04] Cratylus <ds> those are autogenerated byt he races daemon
[11Mar2006-17:04:14] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Ah...
[11Mar2006-17:04:42] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Any way to fiddle with that short of rewriting the daemon entirely?
[11Mar2006-17:05:48] Cratylus <ds> no need. next release will output the file in help/races instead of the autogenerated stuff, if the file is there
[11Mar2006-17:06:17] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Oh, good.
[11Mar2006-17:06:51] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Hello everyone.
[11Mar2006-17:06:55] Cratylus <ds> howdy
[11Mar2006-17:07:03] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> hello
[11Mar2006-17:07:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> Hey crat, I finally got a working quest up.
[11Mar2006-17:07:21] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> It sucks, but works none the less.
[11Mar2006-17:07:23] Cratylus <ds> awesome
[11Mar2006-17:07:41] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> cheers
[11Mar2006-17:07:57] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> sorry not very good with emote yet
[11Mar2006-17:08:29] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> can you emote over ds?
[11Mar2006-17:08:58] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> no idea, force of habit from playing on other muds
[11Mar2006-17:09:00] Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin <dead_souls> Perhaps the racial description could be part of the race file format?
[11Mar2006-17:09:02] Cratylus <ds> dsemote cheers.
[11Mar2006-17:09:14] <dead_souls> Niang@Kol cheers
[11Mar2006-17:09:20] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> thanx
[11Mar2006-17:09:22] Cratylus <ds> np
[11Mar2006-17:09:26] <dead_souls> Oriam@Age of Darkness cheers.
[11Mar2006-17:09:28] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> cool
[11Mar2006-17:09:34] <dead_souls> Alensin@Dead_Souls_alensin cackles.
[11Mar2006-17:10:00] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> thing is every mud i've every played on dose it diffently
[11Mar2006-17:11:30] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> same here
[11Mar2006-17:11:42] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> ahhh i've got a poor likkle goblin sentry with no armour or weapons
[11Mar2006-17:11:57] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> but then again, ive only played on two other muds, and by definition the one doesnt qualify as a mud
[11Mar2006-17:12:47] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i've played on a few, i started (and still play elephant mud) i've also played starmud and nightmare
[11Mar2006-17:13:05] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> im active on Ages of Despair, but i use to play Nightmist
[11Mar2006-17:15:46] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> hey crat, you programmed all the pre loaded areas right?
[11Mar2006-17:17:14] Cratylus <ds> Ylsrim is not mine
[11Mar2006-17:17:20] Cratylus <ds> but town and default are
[11Mar2006-17:17:55] Cratylus <ds> Ylsrim is from the original 1.1 release, though i did have to work on it to get it to work
[11Mar2006-17:22:28] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> where are the efuns located?
[11Mar2006-17:23:32] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> next to the dfuns andjust before the ffuns?
[11Mar2006-17:23:40] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ...
[11Mar2006-17:24:28] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> sorry i'm in a very silly mood this evening
[11Mar2006-17:25:35] Cratylus <ds> heh
[11Mar2006-17:26:23] Cratylus <ds> http://dead-souls.sourceforge.net/ds-admin-faq.html
[11Mar2006-17:34:40] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> kay i got a question about vendors
[11Mar2006-17:35:36] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> anything in the room i designate as a storage room is sold by the vendor correct?
[11Mar2006-17:36:10] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> nvm
[11Mar2006-17:41:58] Cratylus <ds> ok intermud is back i guess
[11Mar2006-17:42:04] Cratylus <ds> damn its been really flaky lately
[11Mar2006-17:42:10] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> lol its all good
[11Mar2006-17:42:38] Cratylus <ds> anyway, oriam, please read the admin faq at http://dead-souls.sourceforge.net/ds-admin-faq.html for an explanation of efuns
[11Mar2006-17:42:52] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i know what they are, i just didnt know where to find em
[11Mar2006-17:42:58] Cratylus <ds> and yes anything in the vebdors storage room is sellable by them
[11Mar2006-17:43:12] Cratylus <ds> they're in the driver, not findable on the lib
[11Mar2006-17:43:38] Cratylus <ds> you'll have to go through the C++ code in v22.2b14
[11Mar2006-17:43:58] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> sooner you than me oriam :)
[11Mar2006-17:44:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> what are estates?
[11Mar2006-17:44:35] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i cant seem to find any files directly describing them
[11Mar2006-17:45:01] Cratylus <ds> that's legacy or unimplemented functionality, depending on yer point of view. theres nothing set up for it now, but that's where player rooms go
[11Mar2006-17:45:11] Cratylus <ds> in nightmare, players could buy houses n stuff
[11Mar2006-17:45:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> ahh okay
[11Mar2006-17:45:19] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> yeah, you can do that in my other mud
[11Mar2006-17:45:41] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> i just planned on taking direct requests for them then hand coding it.
[11Mar2006-17:46:13] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> god bless the QCS
[11Mar2006-17:46:23] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> amen to that
[11Mar2006-17:47:21] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i think they should create a new nobel prize of muds and That would most definatly get the first prize
[11Mar2006-17:47:42] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> whats that?
[11Mar2006-17:48:00] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> the QCS
[11Mar2006-17:48:38] Oriam@Age of Darkness <dead_souls> well im out guys, see ya later
[11Mar2006-17:48:46] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> bye
[11Mar2006-17:49:10] Cratylus <ds> seeya
[11Mar2006-17:51:25] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> ok a little direction here please, i'm looking for the coding that does the checking to see if you can wield a weapon.  I know i can alter it for each weapon but i wanted to look at the one that is already there,  any ideas which files i should be looking at?
[11Mar2006-17:52:25] Cratylus <ds> hmm
[11Mar2006-17:52:59] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i did a serch looking for wield and got about 30 result :(
[11Mar2006-17:53:13] Cratylus <ds> type: read chapter 29 in manual
[11Mar2006-17:55:12] <dead_souls> Avatar@OuterSpace likes the sound of tbat (up to date documentation rocks)
[11Mar2006-18:02:18] Cratylus <ds> yeah i'm just finishing up docs now in preparation for the next release. prolly tonight or tomorrow
[11Mar2006-18:02:48] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> and this'll be r15, correct?
[11Mar2006-18:02:56] Cratylus <ds> actually r16
[11Mar2006-18:03:20] Cratylus <ds> some releases are just for sanity checking and not released into the wild
[11Mar2006-18:03:26] <dead_souls> Avatar@OuterSpace will happily explore the new release next weekend.
[11Mar2006-18:03:30] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ah
[11Mar2006-18:03:55] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> it alway gose in twos :), you'll get used to it
[11Mar2006-18:04:33] Cratylus <ds> yeah actually, i guess they are but it isnt really on purpose. it's jus tthat i usually fuck up one last thing and catch it in time
[11Mar2006-18:05:47] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Let's say I was working on an area, would I be able to just drop that in with minimal effort?
[11Mar2006-18:05:49] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> you can't stop doing it now, you'd really throw me
[11Mar2006-18:06:33] Cratylus <ds> heh
[11Mar2006-18:06:37] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> almost certainly if the last releases are anything to go by :)
[11Mar2006-18:07:16] Cratylus <ds> yeah well i really dont recommend trying to upgrade to a new release by copying it over the old one. i release patches for that
[11Mar2006-18:07:40] Cratylus <ds> the patches are important because they contain special files that make corrections that just overwriting cannot
[11Mar2006-18:08:02] Cratylus <ds> but niang is right, i try to make it as painless as possible to upgrade
[11Mar2006-18:08:32] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> k
[11Mar2006-18:09:14] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> it's very painless and i've been 'upgrading' for quite a while now, if i can do then most people can
[11Mar2006-18:09:36] Cratylus <ds> it's painful for maniacs like brodbane and ashon because patches often contain files like player.c etc which theyve been working on themselves
[11Mar2006-18:09:54] Cratylus <ds> but if youve only been coding areas n stuff, you'll prolly only notice goodness
[11Mar2006-18:10:09] Cratylus <ds> you should do a full backup anyway, though
[11Mar2006-18:10:33] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> for which you also supply good insturctions
[11Mar2006-18:10:43] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> well for the unix version anyway
[11Mar2006-18:10:53] Cratylus <ds> my best instruction is "do the backup"
[11Mar2006-18:11:07] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> k
[11Mar2006-18:11:13] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i still have to read how to do the tar bit
[11Mar2006-18:11:29] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> That's pretty easy :p
[11Mar2006-18:11:57] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> unix/linux isn't really my element,
[11Mar2006-18:12:27] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i was primarily a Oracle pl/sql database programmer
[11Mar2006-18:12:49] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> rollback and commit, i can cope with
[11Mar2006-18:13:44] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> select * from User where id = 'Smith'  ..... that sort of thing anything else i have to really think about
[11Mar2006-18:14:28] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
[11Mar2006-18:14:38] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Ya, that's an easy query :p
[11Mar2006-18:15:14] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> it most certainly is,
[11Mar2006-18:15:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> cratylus, you'd best give me a diff report for each release!
[11Mar2006-18:16:10] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> pl/sql is quite close to c/C++ and lpc so i can cope with this
[11Mar2006-18:16:26] Cratylus <ds> heh
[11Mar2006-18:17:17] Cratylus <ds> well, you dont HAVE to upgrade
[11Mar2006-18:17:37] Cratylus <ds> but youd be missing out on some nifty new stuff
[11Mar2006-18:21:38] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i'm soory i started that search now :( .. i was hoping to find a nice little formual that, baised on your skills, calulated a max class to the weapon you can wield ....
[11Mar2006-18:22:16] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> unfourtunatly what i've found is if your a newbie and the class  is >30 you can't wield it :(
[11Mar2006-18:25:07] Cratylus <ds> you stop being a newbie at level 4 or so
[11Mar2006-18:25:31] Cratylus <ds> basically if you finish the newbie mansion quest, you can advance past newbieness
[11Mar2006-18:25:51] Cratylus <ds> but if you dislike the newbie concept, just disable it in /secure/include/config.h
[11Mar2006-18:27:02] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> no... i wanted to link the max weapons class to weapon skill, the higher youre skill the better the weapon you can use
[11Mar2006-18:27:14] Cratylus <ds> oh
[11Mar2006-18:27:18] Cratylus <ds> why cant you?
[11Mar2006-18:28:10] Cratylus <ds> you'd have to code it in LIB_WEAPON
[11Mar2006-18:28:18] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i can, i was just looking to see if there wassomething like that already.  I didn't want to reinvent the wheel
[11Mar2006-18:28:26] <ds> Cratylus nods.
[11Mar2006-18:30:49] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> well it's rapiadly appraoching midnight (although i've just had this 'The sun appears just over the horizon.' appear :) ) and i'm on dinner duty tommorow, so i got to get up early :(
[11Mar2006-18:30:59] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> see ya all around
[11Mar2006-18:31:25] <dead_souls> Niang@Kol waves
[11Mar2006-18:31:41] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> Later
[11Mar2006-18:31:51] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> do I recognize a bit of elephant style in that idea Miang?
[11Mar2006-18:32:07] <dead_souls> Niang@Kol nods solemnly.
[11Mar2006-18:32:33] <dead_souls> Avatar@OuterSpace is an elemud player gto ;)
[11Mar2006-18:32:33] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i am an elephant mudder
[11Mar2006-18:32:58] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> really, who if i maybe so bold?
[11Mar2006-18:34:04] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> dolenlhaw
[11Mar2006-18:34:42] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> mmmm don't reconise the name, what class are you?
[11Mar2006-18:34:54] Avatar@OuterSpace <dead_souls> ranger.
[11Mar2006-18:35:00] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> i'v played many characters over teh years,
[11Mar2006-18:35:28] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> ahhh, i'm playing knife the rogue at the moment
[11Mar2006-18:35:44] Niang@Kol <dead_souls> although i'm also known as Nosmo the monk

[11Mar2006-20:15:00] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> intermud must be down again
[11Mar2006-20:22:04] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> you can always go to the arch room and check the printout
[11Mar2006-20:23:55] Jerin@Jerins Folly <dead_souls> ?
[11Mar2006-20:24:55] Cratylus <ds> that can be deceptive
[11Mar2006-20:24:57] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> the ds channel uses the intermud protocols, so if intermud is down, ds wouldn't work either,
[11Mar2006-20:25:11] Cratylus <ds> the next release has a ping feature that lets you test intermud connectivity
[11Mar2006-20:25:58] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> woot!
[11Mar2006-20:27:14] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> just a quick lib question for you Cratylus.
[11Mar2006-20:28:22] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> eventFunctions, ie eventBlessing in /lib/std/item.c  are handled just like any other function right?  or is there actually an event handler?
[11Mar2006-20:33:08] Cratylus <ds> normal
[11Mar2006-20:33:12] Cratylus <ds> no special handler
[11Mar2006-20:33:18] Cratylus <ds> the format is just a convention
[11Mar2006-20:33:48] Cratylus <ds> makes code a bit more understandable
[11Mar2006-20:38:35] Ashon@Stargate Atlantis <dead_souls> sweet.  excellent.
