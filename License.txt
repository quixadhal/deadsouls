Whatever the law says, so it applies here.

Note that the changes to the original Dead Souls release 
of 1998 are copyrighted by me, Bill Sanchez, and 
are NOT GPL. Understanding what that means and
due compliance with applicable laws is left as an
exercise to the reader.

MudOS/FluffOS is being packaged with the lib pursuant to 
standard LPmud practice. Please note that MudOS and FluffOS
are copyrighted, and should we be asked to stop 
distributing them by their respective copyright holders,
we will be obligated to do so.

For explicit details on Dead Souls and MudOS 
bundled distribution, please see:

A few details, for the license fetishists:

* It's ok to run a mud with this. Modify it as you
wish, and do what people normally associate with
"running a mud." You can change anything about the
lib after you download it. It's your mud game. I don't
care what you do with it. But you're encouraged
to share your work with me. 

* If you need to do something like forking development
and distributing your own DS-based lib, you should
use the Public Domain version, not this version. For
info, see: http://dead-souls.net/ds-II-faq.html

* I expect this to be enough information so you
know what you can and can't do lawfully with
this software. I can't stand licensing discussion,
and will not enter into a debate with you about 
what copyright means. I will not answer any
further questions on the subject. This document
is the final word on the matter. If in doubt,
refer to your local laws and regulations concerning
intellectual property.
